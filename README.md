## What is BuzzBuster?
This repository demonstrates the development and implementation of a system for analyzing public
sentiment on X (Twitter before), specifically bullying detection.
## Project Description
This project focuses on using machine learning techniques to analyze text whether it is bullying
or not bullying in tweets. We developed a system that performs the following tasks:
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing: Tweets were gathered using a custom Twitter scraper that filtered relevant keywords or hashtags.
   The tweets were then cleaned to remove irrelevant information, standardizing the text for better machine learning performance.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The collected data was analyzed to explore the distribution and patterns of bullying versus non-bullying tweets.
   Visualizations were used to gain insights into trends and correlations within the data.
3. Model Development: Various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks, and BERT were implemented and compared.
   The models were trained and evaluated on a labeled subset of the data to ensure robustness and reliability, determining the most effective model for sentiment analysis.
4. User Interface Design: A user-friendly interface was created to allow users to input a topic and interact with the trained model to analyze new tweets.

"Long post warning üö® 

I think I‚Äôve figured out why I‚Äôm so turned off with the current left: they have become the establishment. 

Growing up the Republican Party, with its oppressive brand of moral conservatism, felt like the owners of the ‚Äúestablishment.‚Äù

The hippies and the left were a reaction to that. Free love, rock and roll, anti-war, anti-establishment.  That was followed by punk rock culture ‚Äî liberals continued to be the standard bearers of the antiestablishment. 

Even into the 90s/2000s, you had anti-war liberals pushing back against the Falwell moral majority and protesting the Iraq war (that was me üëã).  Then the pushback to the disastrous neocon political movement of the post-9/11 2000s. 

Then it all started to change. Trump in 2016 flipped everything on its head. Suddenly republicans were much less hawkish, ignoring foreign wars. and the liberals lost their mind with TDS. So everything then became a reaction to trump. 

Then covid hit and things really got weird. 

Liberals started pushing for even greater state control. Forced closures of businesses, executive orders, vaccine mandates, clamping down on constitutional rights. 

And they also started cheering US military action abroad in the Ukraine. Obama started this with his love for drone warfare. Now we see the left cheering the political prosecution of their political opponents. Grim. 

So now, all the sudden, the anti-establishment left of the last 60 years has swung hard to become the people they‚Äôve fought against. 

And there‚Äôs nothing less punk rock than fighting for the establishment.",29,348,bullying detected

Episodes: 4
Airs: Jun 7, 2024 - Jun 28, 2024
Airs On: Friday
Original Network: One 31

Main Cast: Charlotte Austin , Engfa Waraha

Plot
In the era of social media, everyone can freely express their opinions about others. They can use harsh words without much consideration, not thinking about the consequences or verifying the truth.

In a relationship between two women, one becomes overly concerned with the opinions of others, making her vulnerable to someone she doesn't know who ends up hurting her. The second woman has never cared much, firmly believing in the adage ""to each their own."" However, at times, she can be remarkably oblivious to the feelings of those around her.

With their love in the spotlight, eyes across the nation scrutinise their every move, passing judgement on ever action.

"Glad to see Quaden is doing well after everything the poor kid endured from bullies...at school & online!

More context:
Quaden Bayles, an Australian indigenous boy, became the focus of a viral video in 2020. Quaden was born with achondroplasia, a form of dwarfism. 

The video, which gained global attention, was filmed by his mother, Yarraka Bayles, on February 19, 2020. It shows Quaden in a highly distressed state, crying uncontrollably in the back of a car after a day at school where he was bullied. 

The emotional intensity of the video is evident as Quaden expresses a desire to harm himself, saying, ‚ÄúI wish I could stab myself in the heart‚Äù and ‚ÄúGive me a knife, I want to k*ll myself‚Äù‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã.

"Theres this false narrative going around that I ‚Äúdefended Nick‚Äù & am therefore ‚Äúpro child neglect/abuse including drugs & swinging‚Äù.

Every time I‚Äôve confronted someone accusing me of this I ask for them to provide me with one single receipt and they can‚Äôt because they don‚Äôt exist. You want to get mad because I‚Äôve been on stream with people who have opinions you do or don‚Äôt like & I didn‚Äôt say anything? Well newsflash I rarely chime in to topics I have zero desire to discuss. Just because others have opinions doesn‚Äôt mean I agree with them simply because I‚Äôm in their presence. I think water tastes disgusting; I‚Äôm in fully aware that 99.9% of the population disagrees & that‚Äôs fine. Just because you‚Äôre in my presence doesn‚Äôt mean you automatically share my views(crazy how that works right).

Now another accusation is that I‚Äôm ‚Äúdefending Nick‚Äù because I called out Aaron.  Idk if it‚Äôs willing ignorance or you‚Äôre just not intelligent enough to understand that just because you‚Äôve deemed one person the ultimate villain does not disqualify other monsters in the situation. Before all this started I didn‚Äôt know who tf this guy was. What I saw was a total sleezeball capitalizing on a situation for personal gain at the expense of children. My entire timeline was full of this jackass stirring the pot with disgusting sex stories that had nothing to actually do with the case but were just his ‚Äúinside scoop‚Äù for his 15minutes of fame. It absolutely disgusted me that someone could say the things he did stream after stream with a gigantic smile on his face. He knew those kids & claimed to care but was just a POS that didn‚Äôt do anything & yet still instead of helping them only continued to make their lives worse. They‚Äôre from a small town & this is a huge scandal. They‚Äôre already being judged by everyone around them & anyone including them can look up their last name & find any of the streams/clips of that jackass talking shit about their parents. Now if you still don‚Äôt understand why I would choose to call that shit out idk what to tell you this is something even Forest Gump would understand. 

Lastly all this situation has done has open my eyes to the amount of cancel culture pigs on my timeline. Every single one of you that accused me shit because I kept my opinions to myself are no better than the wackos that went after Gina or anyone else that steps out of line & doesn‚Äôt conform to your ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù. I‚Äôve seen your tweets & know who you are. All of you with the ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not with me then you‚Äôre my enemy‚Äù narrative should really take a step back and think about what you‚Äôre doing because It‚Äôs not good. Maybe take a minute & apply some common sense before demonizing me of ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù I didn‚Äôt commit or making accusations against me because I didn‚Äôt ‚Äústep in line‚Äù in the what you considered is a timely manner. Canceling me over your imaginary opinions won‚Äôt end well & forcing me to bend the knee to your will is only going to end in disappointment for you. I don‚Äôt put up with that kind of bs & I never will. 

At the end of the day my opinion on this really doesn‚Äôt matter nor will it change a single thing. Those kids have seen enough & me adding to it ultimately will not help. Everyone that actually knows me knows where I stand on this including Nick. Going after me with pitchforks because you want blood isn‚Äôt going to solve anything.

It involves a range of manipulative behaviors like gaslighting, blame-shifting, devaluation, and constant belittling and criticism that erodes your self-esteem. The abuser will try to control and isolates you, cutting you off from support and making you feel dependent and powerless. They may alternate between being nice and cruel, leaving you in a constant state of anxiety, desperately seeking their approval. The victim may look like they are lying or crazy when they try to explain what‚Äôs going on because the narcissist‚Äôs two-faced nature is shamelessly hidden behind a mask of charm, lies, manipulation and smear campaigns.

Growing up the Republican Party, with its oppressive brand of moral conservatism, felt like the owners of the ‚Äúestablishment.‚Äù

The hippies and the left were a reaction to that. Free love, rock and roll, anti-war, anti-establishment.  That was followed by punk rock culture ‚Äî liberals continued to be the standard bearers of the antiestablishment. 

Even into the 90s/2000s, you had anti-war liberals pushing back against the Falwell moral majority and protesting the Iraq war (that was me üëã).  Then the pushback to the disastrous neocon political movement of the post-9/11 2000s. 

Then it all started to change. Trump in 2016 flipped everything on its head. Suddenly republicans were much less hawkish, ignoring foreign wars. and the liberals lost their mind with TDS. So everything then became a reaction to trump. 

Then covid hit and things really got weird. 

Liberals started pushing for even greater state control. Forced closures of businesses, executive orders, vaccine mandates, clamping down on constitutional rights. 

And they also started cheering US military action abroad in the Ukraine. Obama started this with his love for drone warfare. Now we see the left cheering the political prosecution of their political opponents. Grim.

"High Court and Court of Appeal Ruling Ignored as Senior DCI Officers Harass Landowner 

In 2010, Bharat Ramji, Harish Ramji, and Ashvin Ramji purchased a parcel of land from the National Social Security Fund (NSSF).

This prime real estate situated along Mombasa Road Next to the Mombasa Cement factory was a major investment but what began as a promising acquisition soon spiraled into a bitter legal battle marked by fraud, goon invasion, and allegations of corruption within our law enforcement system.

The Ramji family's ordeal started innocuously enough.

They acquired the land legally, receiving the title deed from NSSF.

But as fate would have it, Mombasa Cement Limited, a powerful entity with deep connections, had its sights set on the same land.

In a brazen move, Mombasa Cement deposited money into the NSSF account without any formal agreement or authorization, following which they orchestrated an illegal eviction of the Ramjis using hired goons who not only evicted them but also demolished parts of the boundary wall to amalgamate the property with their own factory premises.

The Ramjis, now dispossessed of their land, sought justice in the High Court at Milimani.

Justice Kossy Bor presided over the case, which seemed straightforward enough given the clear legal ownership documents the Ramjis held but in a surprising turn of events, Justice Bor ruled in favor of Mombasa Cement, validating the company's counterclaims of fraud and improper acquisition against the Ramjis.

The ruling shocked many and was perceived as a glaring miscarriage of justice.

Undeterred, the Ramjis appealed to the Court of Appeal and their persistence paid off.

In Civil Appeal No. 590 of 2019, the appellate judges ‚Äì Justices Musinga, Ngenye, and Omondi ‚Äì delivered a scathing critique of the lower court's judgment.

They meticulously dismantled the arguments presented by Mombasa Cement and acknowledged the validity of the Ramjis' title.

The Court of Appeal ordered that the land be restored to the Ramjis and Mombasa Cement evicted.

By March 2024, the property was rightfully back in the hands of its owners which marked a legal victory for the family.

But the victory was short-lived.

Mombasa Cement (leveraging its connections within the corridors of power) launched a retaliatory campaign.

Using its influence, particularly its involvement in constructing police station walls in Mombasa and Nairobi, Mombasa Cement enlisted the help of high-ranking officers within the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) and reportedly hatched a plan to reverse the Court of Appeal's decision.

The strategy was to use their authority to harass and intimidate the Ramji family in an attempt to coerce them into relinquishing their land once more.

The summonses came swiftly.

Bharat, Harish, and Ashvin Ramji were repeatedly called in for questioning by the DCI.

Under relentless pressure, they turned to the judicial system for protection.

Kiambu High Court became their refuge.

On 24th April 2024, Bharat Ramji, Harish Ramji and Ashvin Ramji obtained crucial judicial review orders from the Kiambu High Court which were signed by Hon. Lady Justice Dorah Chepkwony. 

These orders were issued to restrain the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) and the Inspector General of Police from arresting or harassing the Ramji family. 

The application was certified as urgent.

Court granted leave to the Ramjis to file a substantive judicial review application which allowed them to formally challenge the actions of the DCI and the Inspector General of Police.

The leave granted operated as a stay, meaning that any actions by the DCI or the Inspector General of Police to arrest or harass the Ramjis were temporarily halted pending the hearing and determination of the substantive judicial review 

The matter was set for mention on 20th June 2024 to confirm compliance with the court orders and to ensure that the judicial process was being followed correctly.

DCI and Inspector General of Police were given seven days upon service of the court orders to file their response to the judicial review application.

Despite having been served with orders restraining the arrest via Kiambu High Court Judicial Review Case No. HCJR/E010/2024, Wilhelm K. Kimutai (emboldened by his connections and a misplaced sense of invincibility) continued his campaign of harassment, ignoring the High Court's orders and further complicating the Ramji family's efforts to reclaim their property.

In their detailed judgment, the Court of Appeal judges found substantial flaws in the initial trial court's handling of the case.

They pointed out several key misdirections.

The appellate court noted that the trial judge had disregarded crucial evidence regarding the assignment of the suit property from Golden Terrace to the Ramjis.

""The learned judge failed to appreciate and give effect to the provisions of section 23 (1) of the Registration of Titles Act,"" the Court of Appeal stated.

The Court of Appeal also underscored the indefensibility of the Ramjis' title, stating, ""There was no dispute that they were the registered proprietors of the suit property."" The judges criticized the trial court for not recognizing this legal fact.

Addressing the clerical error in the transfer documents, the Court of Appeal clarified, ""It is obvious that there was a clerical error in the preparation of the transfer document in making reference to LR No. 11895/48 when the subject matter in the entire transfer was LR No. 11895/50.""",32,115,bullying detected

In the autumn of 2022 I ended up in an eight week pile on in which I spent a long time trying to reason with people who were not interested in any good faith engagement and whose behaviour towards me was at best hostile and at worst extremely abusive.

I have since decided I am not obliged to be anybody‚Äôs punching bag. And I now advise anyone else who ends up in a similar situation the same.

"10. Club Friday Season 16: Love Bully (2024)

Episodes: 4
Airs: Jun 7, 2024 - Jun 28, 2024
Airs On: Friday
Original Network: One 31

Main Cast: Charlotte Austin , Engfa Waraha

Plot
In the era of social media, everyone can freely express their opinions about others. They can use harsh words without much consideration, not thinking about the consequences or verifying the truth.

In a relationship between two women, one becomes overly concerned with the opinions of others, making her vulnerable to someone she doesn't know who ends up hurting her. The second woman has never cared much, firmly believing in the adage ""to each their own."" However, at times, she can be remarkably oblivious to the feelings of those around her.

With their love in the spotlight, eyes across the nation scrutinise their every move, passing judgement on ever action.

"Remember when you were a kid - there was always that one kid who used to literally get away with everything. A kid could either talk their way out of trouble or had a few friends or parents in high places who would cover up their misadventures or bully others into ‚Äúforgetting‚Äù about it.

It amounted to zero consequences for the little zunt - and a fast developing attitude that they could literally go through life expecting no consequences for any actions.

Some of those kids might grow out of it after they‚Äôve ‚Äúlearned a lesson or two‚Äù - but others remain forever that little zunt who could do no wrong - and to accuse them of anything - regardless of their nefarious actions  - would result in everybody but them having a bad day.

I see it re-enacted over and over again in politics and business via people in positions of power - and by those who want that power and think that they deserve it, regardless of how undeserving they are. 

That little zunt literally destroys democracy because they have no respect for equality or fairness and they have no boundaries.

I can think of a few people like that. The more entitled they have been raised to be - or learned to be - and have gotten away with it - the more likely they are to be boundary free narcissists and sociopaths.

I‚Äôm pretty sure that Trump, Dutton, Morrison, authoritarian leaders and many self-entitled extremists fit the bill.",19,88,no bullying

"Theres this false narrative going around that I ‚Äúdefended Nick‚Äù & am therefore ‚Äúpro child neglect/abuse including drugs & swinging‚Äù. This false narrative has been repeated in my mentions for days all because I‚Äôm guilty of not immediately giving my opinion & condemning Nick. Every time I‚Äôve confronted someone accusing me of this I ask for them to provide me with one single receipt and they can‚Äôt because they don‚Äôt exist. You want to get mad because I‚Äôve been on stream with people who have opinions you do or don‚Äôt like & I didn‚Äôt say anything? Well newsflash I rarely chime in to topics I have zero desire to discuss. Just because others have opinions doesn‚Äôt mean I agree with them simply because I‚Äôm in their presence. I think water tastes disgusting; I‚Äôm in fully aware that 99.9% of the population disagrees & that‚Äôs fine. Just because you‚Äôre in my presence doesn‚Äôt mean you automatically share my views(crazy how that works right).

Now another accusation is that I‚Äôm ‚Äúdefending Nick‚Äù because I called out Aaron.  Idk if it‚Äôs willing ignorance or you‚Äôre just not intelligent enough to understand that just because you‚Äôve deemed one person the ultimate villain does not disqualify other monsters in the situation. Before all this started I didn‚Äôt know who tf this guy was. What I saw was a total sleezeball capitalizing on a situation for personal gain at the expense of children. My entire timeline was full of this jackass stirring the pot with disgusting sex stories that had nothing to actually do with the case but were just his ‚Äúinside scoop‚Äù for his 15minutes of fame. It absolutely disgusted me that someone could say the things he did stream after stream with a gigantic smile on his face. He knew those kids & claimed to care but was just a POS that didn‚Äôt do anything & yet still instead of helping them only continued to make their lives worse. They‚Äôre from a small town & this is a huge scandal. They‚Äôre already being judged by everyone around them & anyone including them can look up their last name & find any of the streams/clips of that jackass talking shit about their parents. Now if you still don‚Äôt understand why I would choose to call that shit out idk what to tell you this is something even Forest Gump would understand. 

Lastly all this situation has done has open my eyes to the amount of cancel culture pigs on my timeline. Every single one of you that accused me shit because I kept my opinions to myself are no better than the wackos that went after Gina or anyone else that steps out of line & doesn‚Äôt conform to your ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù. I‚Äôve seen your tweets & know who you are. All of you with the ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not with me then you‚Äôre my enemy‚Äù narrative should really take a step back and think about what you‚Äôre doing because It‚Äôs not good. Maybe take a minute & apply some common sense before demonizing me of ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù I didn‚Äôt commit or making accusations against me because I didn‚Äôt ‚Äústep in line‚Äù in the what you considered is a timely manner. Canceling me over your imaginary opinions won‚Äôt end well & forcing me to bend the knee to your will is only going to end in disappointment for you. I don‚Äôt put up with that kind of bs & I never will. 

At the end of the day my opinion on this really doesn‚Äôt matter nor will it change a single thing. Those kids have seen enough & me adding to it ultimately will not help. Everyone that actually knows me knows where I stand on this including Nick. Going after me with pitchforks because you want blood isn‚Äôt going to solve anything.

"#NarcissisticAbuse is a devastating form of emotional and psychological abuse caused by someone with high narcissistic traits. It involves a range of manipulative behaviors like gaslighting, blame-shifting, devaluation, and constant belittling and criticism that erodes your self-esteem. The abuser will try to control and isolates you, cutting you off from support and making you feel dependent and powerless. They may alternate between being nice and cruel, leaving you in a constant state of anxiety, desperately seeking their approval. The victim may look like they are lying or crazy when they try to explain what‚Äôs going on because the narcissist‚Äôs two-faced nature is shamelessly hidden behind a mask of charm, lies, manipulation and smear campaigns. This kind of abuse can lead to serious emotional damage, including anxiety, depression, a loss of self-worth, and in extreme cases, C-PTSD, self medication, or suicide. It could be described as covert psychological violence.",224,497,bullying detected

Growing up the Republican Party, with its oppressive brand of moral conservatism, felt like the owners of the ‚Äúestablishment.‚Äù

The hippies and the left were a reaction to that. Free love, rock and roll, anti-war, anti-establishment.  That was followed by punk rock culture ‚Äî liberals continued to be the standard bearers of the antiestablishment. 

Even into the 90s/2000s, you had anti-war liberals pushing back against the Falwell moral majority and protesting the Iraq war (that was me üëã).  Then the pushback to the disastrous neocon political movement of the post-9/11 2000s. 

Then it all started to change. Trump in 2016 flipped everything on its head. Suddenly republicans were much less hawkish, ignoring foreign wars. and the liberals lost their mind with TDS. So everything then became a reaction to trump. 

Then covid hit and things really got weird. 

Liberals started pushing for even greater state control. Forced closures of businesses, executive orders, vaccine mandates, clamping down on constitutional rights. 

And they also started cheering US military action abroad in the Ukraine. Obama started this with his love for drone warfare. Now we see the left cheering the political prosecution of their political opponents. Grim. 

So now, all the sudden, the anti-establishment left of the last 60 years has swung hard to become the people they‚Äôve fought against. 

And there‚Äôs nothing less punk rock than fighting for the establishment.",29,346,bullying detected

Episodes: 4
Airs: Jun 7, 2024 - Jun 28, 2024
Airs On: Friday
Original Network: One 31

Main Cast: Charlotte Austin , Engfa Waraha

Plot
In the era of social media, everyone can freely express their opinions about others. They can use harsh words without much consideration, not thinking about the consequences or verifying the truth.

In a relationship between two women, one becomes overly concerned with the opinions of others, making her vulnerable to someone she doesn't know who ends up hurting her. The second woman has never cared much, firmly believing in the adage ""to each their own."" However, at times, she can be remarkably oblivious to the feelings of those around her.

With their love in the spotlight, eyes across the nation scrutinise their every move, passing judgement on ever action.

"Glad to see Quaden is doing well after everything the poor kid endured from bullies...at school & online!

More context:
Quaden Bayles, an Australian indigenous boy, became the focus of a viral video in 2020. Quaden was born with achondroplasia, a form of dwarfism. 

The video, which gained global attention, was filmed by his mother, Yarraka Bayles, on February 19, 2020. It shows Quaden in a highly distressed state, crying uncontrollably in the back of a car after a day at school where he was bullied. 

The emotional intensity of the video is evident as Quaden expresses a desire to harm himself, saying, ‚ÄúI wish I could stab myself in the heart‚Äù and ‚ÄúGive me a knife, I want to k*ll myself‚Äù‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã.

This video resonated with millions around the world, highlighting the severe impact of bullying on young individuals, particularly those with physical differences.

To make matters even worse, cyber bullies attacked the family and made false claims about Quaden's age.

The Head of State is confident that Russian dictator Putin will not stop in Ukraine and will continue to move on if he wins the war. According to the President, Trump's agreement with Putin will not stop the dictator, and the US will weaken its position in the world.

‚ÄúAnd then Putin will move on, realizing that the United States is no longer such a big player. And then other authoritarian leaders of other countries will enter the arena. And so you have a ceasefire and the beginning of what everyone is afraid to talk about. This is World War III,‚Äù the Ukrainian president said.",113,639,bullying detected

"Long post warning üö® 

I think I‚Äôve figured out why I‚Äôm so turned off with the current left: they have become the establishment. 

Growing up the Republican Party, with its oppressive brand of moral conservatism, felt like the owners of the ‚Äúestablishment.‚Äù

The hippies and the left were a reaction to that. Free love, rock and roll, anti-war, anti-establishment.  That was followed by punk rock culture ‚Äî liberals continued to be the standard bearers of the antiestablishment. 

Even into the 90s/2000s, you had anti-war liberals pushing back against the Falwell moral majority and protesting the Iraq war (that was me üëã).  Then the pushback to the disastrous neocon political movement of the post-9/11 2000s. 

Then it all started to change. Trump in 2016 flipped everything on its head. Suddenly republicans were much less hawkish, ignoring foreign wars. and the liberals lost their mind with TDS. So everything then became a reaction to trump. 

Then covid hit and things really got weird. 

Liberals started pushing for even greater state control. Forced closures of businesses, executive orders, vaccine mandates, clamping down on constitutional rights. 

And they also started cheering US military action abroad in the Ukraine. Obama started this with his love for drone warfare. Now we see the left cheering the political prosecution of their political opponents. Grim. 

So now, all the sudden, the anti-establishment left of the last 60 years has swung hard to become the people they‚Äôve fought against. 

And there‚Äôs nothing less punk rock than fighting for the establishment.",28,343,bullying detected

In the autumn of 2022 I ended up in an eight week pile on in which I spent a long time trying to reason with people who were not interested in any good faith engagement and whose behaviour towards me was at best hostile and at worst extremely abusive.

"High Court and Court of Appeal Ruling Ignored as Senior DCI Officers Harass Landowner 

In 2010, Bharat Ramji, Harish Ramji, and Ashvin Ramji purchased a parcel of land from the National Social Security Fund (NSSF).

This prime real estate situated along Mombasa Road Next to the Mombasa Cement factory was a major investment but what began as a promising acquisition soon spiraled into a bitter legal battle marked by fraud, goon invasion, and allegations of corruption within our law enforcement system.

The Ramji family's ordeal started innocuously enough.

They acquired the land legally, receiving the title deed from NSSF.

But as fate would have it, Mombasa Cement Limited, a powerful entity with deep connections, had its sights set on the same land.

In a brazen move, Mombasa Cement deposited money into the NSSF account without any formal agreement or authorization, following which they orchestrated an illegal eviction of the Ramjis using hired goons who not only evicted them but also demolished parts of the boundary wall to amalgamate the property with their own factory premises.

The Ramjis, now dispossessed of their land, sought justice in the High Court at Milimani.

Justice Kossy Bor presided over the case, which seemed straightforward enough given the clear legal ownership documents the Ramjis held but in a surprising turn of events, Justice Bor ruled in favor of Mombasa Cement, validating the company's counterclaims of fraud and improper acquisition against the Ramjis.

The ruling shocked many and was perceived as a glaring miscarriage of justice.

Undeterred, the Ramjis appealed to the Court of Appeal and their persistence paid off.

In Civil Appeal No. 590 of 2019, the appellate judges ‚Äì Justices Musinga, Ngenye, and Omondi ‚Äì delivered a scathing critique of the lower court's judgment.

They meticulously dismantled the arguments presented by Mombasa Cement and acknowledged the validity of the Ramjis' title.

The Court of Appeal ordered that the land be restored to the Ramjis and Mombasa Cement evicted.

By March 2024, the property was rightfully back in the hands of its owners which marked a legal victory for the family.

But the victory was short-lived.

Mombasa Cement (leveraging its connections within the corridors of power) launched a retaliatory campaign.

Using its influence, particularly its involvement in constructing police station walls in Mombasa and Nairobi, Mombasa Cement enlisted the help of high-ranking officers within the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) and reportedly hatched a plan to reverse the Court of Appeal's decision.

The strategy was to use their authority to harass and intimidate the Ramji family in an attempt to coerce them into relinquishing their land once more.

The summonses came swiftly.

Bharat, Harish, and Ashvin Ramji were repeatedly called in for questioning by the DCI.

Under relentless pressure, they turned to the judicial system for protection.

Kiambu High Court became their refuge.

On 24th April 2024, Bharat Ramji, Harish Ramji and Ashvin Ramji obtained crucial judicial review orders from the Kiambu High Court which were signed by Hon. Lady Justice Dorah Chepkwony. 

These orders were issued to restrain the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) and the Inspector General of Police from arresting or harassing the Ramji family. 

The application was certified as urgent.

Court granted leave to the Ramjis to file a substantive judicial review application which allowed them to formally challenge the actions of the DCI and the Inspector General of Police.

The leave granted operated as a stay, meaning that any actions by the DCI or the Inspector General of Police to arrest or harass the Ramjis were temporarily halted pending the hearing and determination of the substantive judicial review 

The matter was set for mention on 20th June 2024 to confirm compliance with the court orders and to ensure that the judicial process was being followed correctly.

DCI and Inspector General of Police were given seven days upon service of the court orders to file their response to the judicial review application.

Despite having been served with orders restraining the arrest via Kiambu High Court Judicial Review Case No. HCJR/E010/2024, Wilhelm K. Kimutai (emboldened by his connections and a misplaced sense of invincibility) continued his campaign of harassment, ignoring the High Court's orders and further complicating the Ramji family's efforts to reclaim their property.

In their detailed judgment, the Court of Appeal judges found substantial flaws in the initial trial court's handling of the case.

They pointed out several key misdirections.

The appellate court noted that the trial judge had disregarded crucial evidence regarding the assignment of the suit property from Golden Terrace to the Ramjis.

""The learned judge failed to appreciate and give effect to the provisions of section 23 (1) of the Registration of Titles Act,"" the Court of Appeal stated.

The Court of Appeal also underscored the indefensibility of the Ramjis' title, stating, ""There was no dispute that they were the registered proprietors of the suit property."" The judges criticized the trial court for not recognizing this legal fact.

Addressing the clerical error in the transfer documents, the Court of Appeal clarified, ""It is obvious that there was a clerical error in the preparation of the transfer document in making reference to LR No. 11895/48 when the subject matter in the entire transfer was LR No. 11895/50.""",32,115,bullying detected

Episodes: 4

Airs On: Friday
Original Network: One 31

Main Cast: Charlotte Austin , Engfa Waraha

Plot
In the era of social media, everyone can freely express their opinions about others. They can use harsh words without much consideration, not thinking about the consequences or verifying the truth.

In a relationship between two women, one becomes overly concerned with the opinions of others, making her vulnerable to someone she doesn't know who ends up hurting her. The second woman has never cared much, firmly believing in the adage ""to each their own."" However, at times, she can be remarkably oblivious to the feelings of those around her.

With their love in the spotlight, eyes across the nation scrutinise their every move, passing judgement on ever action.

"Remember when you were a kid - there was always that one kid who used to literally get away with everything. A kid could either talk their way out of trouble or had a few friends or parents in high places who would cover up their misadventures or bully others into ‚Äúforgetting‚Äù about it.

It amounted to zero consequences for the little zunt - and a fast developing attitude that they could literally go through life expecting no consequences for any actions.

Some of those kids might grow out of it after they‚Äôve ‚Äúlearned a lesson or two‚Äù - but others remain forever that little zunt who could do no wrong - and to accuse them of anything - regardless of their nefarious actions  - would result in everybody but them having a bad day.

I see it re-enacted over and over again in politics and business via people in positions of power - and by those who want that power and think that they deserve it, regardless of how undeserving they are. 

That little zunt literally destroys democracy because they have no respect for equality or fairness and they have no boundaries.

I can think of a few people like that. The more entitled they have been raised to be - or learned to be - and have gotten away with it - the more likely they are to be boundary free narcissists and sociopaths.

Every time I‚Äôve confronted someone accusing me of this I ask for them to provide me with one single receipt and they can‚Äôt because they don‚Äôt exist. You want to get mad because I‚Äôve been on stream with people who have opinions you do or don‚Äôt like & I didn‚Äôt say anything? Well newsflash I rarely chime in to topics I have zero desire to discuss. Just because others have opinions doesn‚Äôt mean I agree with them simply because I‚Äôm in their presence. I think water tastes disgusting; I‚Äôm in fully aware that 99.9% of the population disagrees & that‚Äôs fine. Just because you‚Äôre in my presence doesn‚Äôt mean you automatically share my views(crazy how that works right).

Now another accusation is that I‚Äôm ‚Äúdefending Nick‚Äù because I called out Aaron.  Idk if it‚Äôs willing ignorance or you‚Äôre just not intelligent enough to understand that just because you‚Äôve deemed one person the ultimate villain does not disqualify other monsters in the situation. Before all this started I didn‚Äôt know who tf this guy was. What I saw was a total sleezeball capitalizing on a situation for personal gain at the expense of children. My entire timeline was full of this jackass stirring the pot with disgusting sex stories that had nothing to actually do with the case but were just his ‚Äúinside scoop‚Äù for his 15minutes of fame. It absolutely disgusted me that someone could say the things he did stream after stream with a gigantic smile on his face. He knew those kids & claimed to care but was just a POS that didn‚Äôt do anything & yet still instead of helping them only continued to make their lives worse. They‚Äôre from a small town & this is a huge scandal. They‚Äôre already being judged by everyone around them & anyone including them can look up their last name & find any of the streams/clips of that jackass talking shit about their parents. Now if you still don‚Äôt understand why I would choose to call that shit out idk what to tell you this is something even Forest Gump would understand. 

Lastly all this situation has done has open my eyes to the amount of cancel culture pigs on my timeline. Every single one of you that accused me shit because I kept my opinions to myself are no better than the wackos that went after Gina or anyone else that steps out of line & doesn‚Äôt conform to your ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù. I‚Äôve seen your tweets & know who you are. All of you with the ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not with me then you‚Äôre my enemy‚Äù narrative should really take a step back and think about what you‚Äôre doing because It‚Äôs not good. Maybe take a minute & apply some common sense before demonizing me of ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù I didn‚Äôt commit or making accusations against me because I didn‚Äôt ‚Äústep in line‚Äù in the what you considered is a timely manner. Canceling me over your imaginary opinions won‚Äôt end well & forcing me to bend the knee to your will is only going to end in disappointment for you. I don‚Äôt put up with that kind of bs & I never will. 

At the end of the day my opinion on this really doesn‚Äôt matter nor will it change a single thing. Those kids have seen enough & me adding to it ultimately will not help. Everyone that actually knows me knows where I stand on this including Nick. Going after me with pitchforks because you want blood isn‚Äôt going to solve anything.

'But he calls Netanyahu a war criminal', you'd say in defense of this pseudo-radical for the bourgeois. 'So what?' I'll write you back. What does this mean if it's not backed up by action? What does it do except bolster the system? 

Would you be a member of a lynching club but just not while they were doing the actual lynching? Because this is all Sanders is: a valve to lock fantasy radicals into the system that guarantees the continuation of the oppression. 

Sanders claims to know Netanyahu is a war criminal, but he continues to sit and be part of the body that provides the moral and financial support required for committing said war crimes, all while pretending he's against it and helping the system portray itself as a democracy.  

In doing so, he perpetuates the poisonous lie that one must never break rank with the party and the establishment, no matter what they do. 

This is more destructive for the possibility of change than any other political position. This is more deadly for victims of US imperialism than the stupidest Brian Mast. 

This is what establishment people cast for a Bernie Sanders role do: they strengthen the establishments and create a false impression by which only the establishment is a possible choice.

"High Court and Court of Appeal Ruling Ignored as Senior DCI Officers Harass Landowner 

In 2010, Bharat Ramji, Harish Ramji, and Ashvin Ramji purchased a parcel of land from the National Social Security Fund (NSSF).

This prime real estate situated along Mombasa Road Next to the Mombasa Cement factory was a major investment but what began as a promising acquisition soon spiraled into a bitter legal battle marked by fraud, goon invasion, and allegations of corruption within our law enforcement system.

The Ramji family's ordeal started innocuously enough.

They acquired the land legally, receiving the title deed from NSSF.

But as fate would have it, Mombasa Cement Limited, a powerful entity with deep connections, had its sights set on the same land.

In a brazen move, Mombasa Cement deposited money into the NSSF account without any formal agreement or authorization, following which they orchestrated an illegal eviction of the Ramjis using hired goons who not only evicted them but also demolished parts of the boundary wall to amalgamate the property with their own factory premises.

The Ramjis, now dispossessed of their land, sought justice in the High Court at Milimani.

Justice Kossy Bor presided over the case, which seemed straightforward enough given the clear legal ownership documents the Ramjis held but in a surprising turn of events, Justice Bor ruled in favor of Mombasa Cement, validating the company's counterclaims of fraud and improper acquisition against the Ramjis.

The ruling shocked many and was perceived as a glaring miscarriage of justice.

Undeterred, the Ramjis appealed to the Court of Appeal and their persistence paid off.

In Civil Appeal No. 590 of 2019, the appellate judges ‚Äì Justices Musinga, Ngenye, and Omondi ‚Äì delivered a scathing critique of the lower court's judgment.

They meticulously dismantled the arguments presented by Mombasa Cement and acknowledged the validity of the Ramjis' title.

The Court of Appeal ordered that the land be restored to the Ramjis and Mombasa Cement evicted.

By March 2024, the property was rightfully back in the hands of its owners which marked a legal victory for the family.

But the victory was short-lived.

Mombasa Cement (leveraging its connections within the corridors of power) launched a retaliatory campaign.

Using its influence, particularly its involvement in constructing police station walls in Mombasa and Nairobi, Mombasa Cement enlisted the help of high-ranking officers within the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) and reportedly hatched a plan to reverse the Court of Appeal's decision.

The strategy was to use their authority to harass and intimidate the Ramji family in an attempt to coerce them into relinquishing their land once more.

The summonses came swiftly.

Bharat, Harish, and Ashvin Ramji were repeatedly called in for questioning by the DCI.

Under relentless pressure, they turned to the judicial system for protection.

Kiambu High Court became their refuge.

On 24th April 2024, Bharat Ramji, Harish Ramji and Ashvin Ramji obtained crucial judicial review orders from the Kiambu High Court which were signed by Hon. Lady Justice Dorah Chepkwony. 

These orders were issued to restrain the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) and the Inspector General of Police from arresting or harassing the Ramji family. 

The application was certified as urgent.

Court granted leave to the Ramjis to file a substantive judicial review application which allowed them to formally challenge the actions of the DCI and the Inspector General of Police.

The leave granted operated as a stay, meaning that any actions by the DCI or the Inspector General of Police to arrest or harass the Ramjis were temporarily halted pending the hearing and determination of the substantive judicial review 

The matter was set for mention on 20th June 2024 to confirm compliance with the court orders and to ensure that the judicial process was being followed correctly.

DCI and Inspector General of Police were given seven days upon service of the court orders to file their response to the judicial review application.

Despite having been served with orders restraining the arrest via Kiambu High Court Judicial Review Case No. HCJR/E010/2024, Wilhelm K. Kimutai (emboldened by his connections and a misplaced sense of invincibility) continued his campaign of harassment, ignoring the High Court's orders and further complicating the Ramji family's efforts to reclaim their property.

In their detailed judgment, the Court of Appeal judges found substantial flaws in the initial trial court's handling of the case.

They pointed out several key misdirections.

The appellate court noted that the trial judge had disregarded crucial evidence regarding the assignment of the suit property from Golden Terrace to the Ramjis.

""The learned judge failed to appreciate and give effect to the provisions of section 23 (1) of the Registration of Titles Act,"" the Court of Appeal stated.

The Court of Appeal also underscored the indefensibility of the Ramjis' title, stating, ""There was no dispute that they were the registered proprietors of the suit property."" The judges criticized the trial court for not recognizing this legal fact.

Addressing the clerical error in the transfer documents, the Court of Appeal clarified, ""It is obvious that there was a clerical error in the preparation of the transfer document in making reference to LR No. 11895/48 when the subject matter in the entire transfer was LR No. 11895/50.""",32,115,bullying detected

"Long post warning üö® 

I think I‚Äôve figured out why I‚Äôm so turned off with the current left: they have become the establishment. 

Growing up the Republican Party, with its oppressive brand of moral conservatism, felt like the owners of the ‚Äúestablishment.‚Äù

The hippies and the left were a reaction to that. Free love, rock and roll, anti-war, anti-establishment.  That was followed by punk rock culture ‚Äî liberals continued to be the standard bearers of the antiestablishment. 

Even into the 90s/2000s, you had anti-war liberals pushing back against the Falwell moral majority and protesting the Iraq war (that was me üëã).  Then the pushback to the disastrous neocon political movement of the post-9/11 2000s. 

Then it all started to change. Trump in 2016 flipped everything on its head. Suddenly republicans were much less hawkish, ignoring foreign wars. and the liberals lost their mind with TDS. So everything then became a reaction to trump. 

Then covid hit and things really got weird. 

Liberals started pushing for even greater state control. Forced closures of businesses, executive orders, vaccine mandates, clamping down on constitutional rights. 

And they also started cheering US military action abroad in the Ukraine. Obama started this with his love for drone warfare. Now we see the left cheering the political prosecution of their political opponents. Grim.

Every time I‚Äôve confronted someone accusing me of this I ask for them to provide me with one single receipt and they can‚Äôt because they don‚Äôt exist. You want to get mad because I‚Äôve been on stream with people who have opinions you do or don‚Äôt like & I didn‚Äôt say anything? Well newsflash I rarely chime in to topics I have zero desire to discuss. Just because others have opinions doesn‚Äôt mean I agree with them simply because I‚Äôm in their presence. I think water tastes disgusting; I‚Äôm in fully aware that 99.9% of the population disagrees & that‚Äôs fine. Just because you‚Äôre in my presence doesn‚Äôt mean you automatically share my views(crazy how that works right).

Now another accusation is that I‚Äôm ‚Äúdefending Nick‚Äù because I called out Aaron.  Idk if it‚Äôs willing ignorance or you‚Äôre just not intelligent enough to understand that just because you‚Äôve deemed one person the ultimate villain does not disqualify other monsters in the situation. Before all this started I didn‚Äôt know who tf this guy was. What I saw was a total sleezeball capitalizing on a situation for personal gain at the expense of children.

It absolutely disgusted me that someone could say the things he did stream after stream with a gigantic smile on his face.

They‚Äôre from a small town & this is a huge scandal. They‚Äôre already being judged by everyone around them & anyone including them can look up their last name & find any of the streams/clips of that jackass talking shit about their parents. Now if you still don‚Äôt understand why I would choose to call that shit out idk what to tell you this is something even Forest Gump would understand. 

Lastly all this situation has done has open my eyes to the amount of cancel culture pigs on my timeline.

Maybe take a minute & apply some common sense before demonizing me of ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù I didn‚Äôt commit or making accusations against me because I didn‚Äôt ‚Äústep in line‚Äù in the what you considered is a timely manner.

"#NarcissisticAbuse is a devastating form of emotional and psychological abuse caused by someone with high narcissistic traits. It involves a range of manipulative behaviors like gaslighting, blame-shifting, devaluation, and constant belittling and criticism that erodes your self-esteem. The abuser will try to control and isolates you, cutting you off from support and making you feel dependent and powerless. They may alternate between being nice and cruel, leaving you in a constant state of anxiety, desperately seeking their approval. The victim may look like they are lying or crazy when they try to explain what‚Äôs going on because the narcissist‚Äôs two-faced nature is shamelessly hidden behind a mask of charm, lies, manipulation and smear campaigns. This kind of abuse can lead to serious emotional damage, including anxiety, depression, a loss of self-worth, and in extreme cases, C-PTSD, self medication, or suicide. It could be described as covert psychological violence.",215,480,bullying detected

"I received some hateful comments on my post about Biden. Apparently, I was cruel when I made remarks about his speech and said it made no sense. They say it's ""bullying"" - to write a post about most powerful man in the world, who is trying to save Hamas, so that they'd continue m*rdering, r*ping and kidnapping Israelis.

Isn't it displaced suicidal ""empathy"" that @GadSaad is always talking about?

Powerful white rich man is trying to save horrific monsters from hell, because of his own selfish interests, but I am supposed to be sensitive to his special needs? 

Hamas said that October 7 was great success and they want to continue doing it. To m*rder innocent Israelis, including babies, children, to burn people alive, to ashes, so that it took weeks to identify. To r*pe women while slicing their breasts off and play football with body parts. But sure, the most important is to be kind to a person who wants all this to continue.

Speaking of people with disabilities, many of them were m*rdered, sla*ghtered, r*ped and kidnapped by Hamas.

Ruth Perez with her father Eric were brutally m*rdered by Hamas at music festival. Ruth couldn't walk or talk but music was her life. What kind of monsters don't have mercy for such an innocent disabled girl?

Kapshiter family - parents Dina and Evgeny, and children Alin and Ethan were brutally m*rdered by Hamas monsters, when trying to escape. Hamas savages saw that it is a family with kids in the car, why did they sla*ghter them?? Ethan was a kid with special needs. Alin's body was found in another location weeks after her parents and brother's bodies were found. What did the horrific monsters do to her before m*rdering?

Noya Dan, 13 years old, was autistic girl. Hamas savages dragged her and her grandmother to Gaza border, m*rdered them and dumped their bodies in the dirt.

I have many more examples.
I am thinking about all of them every day.
I can't stop writing about them.
I can't sleep at night.

And white rich supremacist Biden doesn't care. He wants Hamas to win, to recover, to continue. Me, my family, my friends, kids I work with - we all will be the next victims.

"Long post warning üö® 

I think I‚Äôve figured out why I‚Äôm so turned off with the current left: they have become the establishment. 

Growing up the Republican Party, with its oppressive brand of moral conservatism, felt like the owners of the ‚Äúestablishment.‚Äù

The hippies and the left were a reaction to that. Free love, rock and roll, anti-war, anti-establishment.  That was followed by punk rock culture ‚Äî liberals continued to be the standard bearers of the antiestablishment. 

Even into the 90s/2000s, you had anti-war liberals pushing back against the Falwell moral majority and protesting the Iraq war (that was me üëã).  Then the pushback to the disastrous neocon political movement of the post-9/11 2000s. 

Then it all started to change. Trump in 2016 flipped everything on its head. Suddenly republicans were much less hawkish, ignoring foreign wars. and the liberals lost their mind with TDS. So everything then became a reaction to trump. 

Then covid hit and things really got weird. 

Liberals started pushing for even greater state control. Forced closures of businesses, executive orders, vaccine mandates, clamping down on constitutional rights. 

And they also started cheering US military action abroad in the Ukraine. Obama started this with his love for drone warfare. Now we see the left cheering the political prosecution of their political opponents. Grim. 

So now, all the sudden, the anti-establishment left of the last 60 years has swung hard to become the people they‚Äôve fought against.

Episodes: 4
Airs: Jun 7, 2024 - Jun 28, 2024

Original Network: One 31

Main Cast: Charlotte Austin , Engfa Waraha

Plot
In the era of social media, everyone can freely express their opinions about others. They can use harsh words without much consideration, not thinking about the consequences or verifying the truth.

In a relationship between two women, one becomes overly concerned with the opinions of others, making her vulnerable to someone she doesn't know who ends up hurting her. The second woman has never cared much, firmly believing in the adage ""to each their own."" However, at times, she can be remarkably oblivious to the feelings of those around her.

With their love in the spotlight, eyes across the nation scrutinise their every move, passing judgement on ever action.

"If you are one of those ""high road"" Republicans who thinks we should not retaliate in kind, remember that no bully ever stops escalating abuse until you smack him in the mouth.

If that does not convince you, then when the Democrat Einsatzgruppen makes you dig your own shallow grave before they shoot you in the back of your head and send the bill for the bullet to your grieving family, just remember that you ""took the high road.""

"Glad to see Quaden is doing well after everything the poor kid endured from bullies...at school & online!

More context:
Quaden Bayles, an Australian indigenous boy, became the focus of a viral video in 2020. Quaden was born with achondroplasia, a form of dwarfism. 

The video, which gained global attention, was filmed by his mother, Yarraka Bayles, on February 19, 2020. It shows Quaden in a highly distressed state, crying uncontrollably in the back of a car after a day at school where he was bullied. 

The emotional intensity of the video is evident as Quaden expresses a desire to harm himself, saying, ‚ÄúI wish I could stab myself in the heart‚Äù and ‚ÄúGive me a knife, I want to k*ll myself‚Äù‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã.

This video resonated with millions around the world, highlighting the severe impact of bullying on young individuals, particularly those with physical differences.

To make matters even worse, cyber bullies attacked the family and made false claims about Quaden's age. 

This üëáüèº is the original video. It's truly heartbreaking üò™",33,346,bullying detected

"Long post warning üö® 

I think I‚Äôve figured out why I‚Äôm so turned off with the current left: they have become the establishment. 

Growing up the Republican Party, with its oppressive brand of moral conservatism, felt like the owners of the ‚Äúestablishment.‚Äù

The hippies and the left were a reaction to that. Free love, rock and roll, anti-war, anti-establishment.  That was followed by punk rock culture ‚Äî liberals continued to be the standard bearers of the antiestablishment. 

Even into the 90s/2000s, you had anti-war liberals pushing back against the Falwell moral majority and protesting the Iraq war (that was me üëã).  Then the pushback to the disastrous neocon political movement of the post-9/11 2000s. 

Then it all started to change. Trump in 2016 flipped everything on its head. Suddenly republicans were much less hawkish, ignoring foreign wars. and the liberals lost their mind with TDS. So everything then became a reaction to trump. 

Then covid hit and things really got weird. 

Liberals started pushing for even greater state control. Forced closures of businesses, executive orders, vaccine mandates, clamping down on constitutional rights. 

And they also started cheering US military action abroad in the Ukraine. Obama started this with his love for drone warfare. Now we see the left cheering the political prosecution of their political opponents. Grim. 

So now, all the sudden, the anti-establishment left of the last 60 years has swung hard to become the people they‚Äôve fought against.

Episodes: 4
Airs: Jun 7, 2024 - Jun 28, 2024
Airs On: Friday
Original Network: One 31

Main Cast: Charlotte Austin , Engfa Waraha

Plot
In the era of social media, everyone can freely express their opinions about others. They can use harsh words without much consideration, not thinking about the consequences or verifying the truth.

In a relationship between two women, one becomes overly concerned with the opinions of others, making her vulnerable to someone she doesn't know who ends up hurting her. The second woman has never cared much, firmly believing in the adage ""to each their own."" However, at times, she can be remarkably oblivious to the feelings of those around her.

With their love in the spotlight, eyes across the nation scrutinise their every move, passing judgement on ever action.

"Glad to see Quaden is doing well after everything the poor kid endured from bullies...at school & online!

More context:
Quaden Bayles, an Australian indigenous boy, became the focus of a viral video in 2020. Quaden was born with achondroplasia, a form of dwarfism. 

The video, which gained global attention, was filmed by his mother, Yarraka Bayles, on February 19, 2020. It shows Quaden in a highly distressed state, crying uncontrollably in the back of a car after a day at school where he was bullied. 

The emotional intensity of the video is evident as Quaden expresses a desire to harm himself, saying, ‚ÄúI wish I could stab myself in the heart‚Äù and ‚ÄúGive me a knife, I want to k*ll myself‚Äù‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã.

This video resonated with millions around the world, highlighting the severe impact of bullying on young individuals, particularly those with physical differences.

To make matters even worse, cyber bullies attacked the family and made false claims about Quaden's age. 

This üëáüèº is the original video. It's truly heartbreaking üò™",32,338,bullying detected

"So just to be clear. In the autumn of 2022 I ended up in an eight week pile on in which I spent a long time trying to reason with people who were not interested in any good faith engagement and whose behaviour towards me was at best hostile and at worst extremely abusive. At that time I felt obliged to do that, and to try and engage, because we were ostensibly ‚Äòon the same side.‚Äô That was a mistake, and it caused me harm. 

I have since decided I am not obliged to be anybody‚Äôs punching bag. And I now advise anyone else who ends up in a similar situation the same. If you sit around in the corner of people‚Äôs mentions talking shit about them don‚Äôt be surprised if they block you. If you impugn their motives or character don‚Äôt be surprised if they block you. If you lie about them or smear them don‚Äôt be surprised if they block you. If you like tweets doing these things don‚Äôt be surprised if they block you. 

Nobody is obliged to be anybody else‚Äôs punching bag and they have every right to protect themselves as they see fit in order to be able to carry on their work and lives without absorbing whatever spite or rage you think you should be able to chuck at them.

"Long post warning üö® 

I think I‚Äôve figured out why I‚Äôm so turned off with the current left: they have become the establishment. 

Growing up the Republican Party, with its oppressive brand of moral conservatism, felt like the owners of the ‚Äúestablishment.‚Äù

The hippies and the left were a reaction to that. Free love, rock and roll, anti-war, anti-establishment.  That was followed by punk rock culture ‚Äî liberals continued to be the standard bearers of the antiestablishment. 

Even into the 90s/2000s, you had anti-war liberals pushing back against the Falwell moral majority and protesting the Iraq war (that was me üëã).  Then the pushback to the disastrous neocon political movement of the post-9/11 2000s. 

Then it all started to change. Trump in 2016 flipped everything on its head. Suddenly republicans were much less hawkish, ignoring foreign wars. and the liberals lost their mind with TDS. So everything then became a reaction to trump. 

Then covid hit and things really got weird. 

Liberals started pushing for even greater state control. Forced closures of businesses, executive orders, vaccine mandates, clamping down on constitutional rights. 

And they also started cheering US military action abroad in the Ukraine. Obama started this with his love for drone warfare. Now we see the left cheering the political prosecution of their political opponents. Grim. 

So now, all the sudden, the anti-establishment left of the last 60 years has swung hard to become the people they‚Äôve fought against.

He knew those kids & claimed to care but was just a POS that didn‚Äôt do anything & yet still instead of helping them only continued to make their lives worse. They‚Äôre from a small town & this is a huge scandal. They‚Äôre already being judged by everyone around them & anyone including them can look up their last name & find any of the streams/clips of that jackass talking shit about their parents. Now if you still don‚Äôt understand why I would choose to call that shit out idk what to tell you this is something even Forest Gump would understand. 

Lastly all this situation has done has open my eyes to the amount of cancel culture pigs on my timeline. Every single one of you that accused me shit because I kept my opinions to myself are no better than the wackos that went after Gina or anyone else that steps out of line & doesn‚Äôt conform to your ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù.

Canceling me over your imaginary opinions won‚Äôt end well & forcing me to bend the knee to your will is only going to end in disappointment for you.

"High Court and Court of Appeal Ruling Ignored as Senior DCI Officers Harass Landowner 

In 2010, Bharat Ramji, Harish Ramji, and Ashvin Ramji purchased a parcel of land from the National Social Security Fund (NSSF).

This prime real estate situated along Mombasa Road Next to the Mombasa Cement factory was a major investment but what began as a promising acquisition soon spiraled into a bitter legal battle marked by fraud, goon invasion, and allegations of corruption within our law enforcement system.

The Ramji family's ordeal started innocuously enough.

They acquired the land legally, receiving the title deed from NSSF.

But as fate would have it, Mombasa Cement Limited, a powerful entity with deep connections, had its sights set on the same land.

In a brazen move, Mombasa Cement deposited money into the NSSF account without any formal agreement or authorization, following which they orchestrated an illegal eviction of the Ramjis using hired goons who not only evicted them but also demolished parts of the boundary wall to amalgamate the property with their own factory premises.

The Ramjis, now dispossessed of their land, sought justice in the High Court at Milimani.

Justice Kossy Bor presided over the case, which seemed straightforward enough given the clear legal ownership documents the Ramjis held but in a surprising turn of events, Justice Bor ruled in favor of Mombasa Cement, validating the company's counterclaims of fraud and improper acquisition against the Ramjis.

The ruling shocked many and was perceived as a glaring miscarriage of justice.

Undeterred, the Ramjis appealed to the Court of Appeal and their persistence paid off.

In Civil Appeal No. 590 of 2019, the appellate judges ‚Äì Justices Musinga, Ngenye, and Omondi ‚Äì delivered a scathing critique of the lower court's judgment.

They meticulously dismantled the arguments presented by Mombasa Cement and acknowledged the validity of the Ramjis' title.

The Court of Appeal ordered that the land be restored to the Ramjis and Mombasa Cement evicted.

By March 2024, the property was rightfully back in the hands of its owners which marked a legal victory for the family.

But the victory was short-lived.

Mombasa Cement (leveraging its connections within the corridors of power) launched a retaliatory campaign.

Using its influence, particularly its involvement in constructing police station walls in Mombasa and Nairobi, Mombasa Cement enlisted the help of high-ranking officers within the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) and reportedly hatched a plan to reverse the Court of Appeal's decision.

The strategy was to use their authority to harass and intimidate the Ramji family in an attempt to coerce them into relinquishing their land once more.

The summonses came swiftly.

Bharat, Harish, and Ashvin Ramji were repeatedly called in for questioning by the DCI.

Under relentless pressure, they turned to the judicial system for protection.

Kiambu High Court became their refuge.

On 24th April 2024, Bharat Ramji, Harish Ramji and Ashvin Ramji obtained crucial judicial review orders from the Kiambu High Court which were signed by Hon. Lady Justice Dorah Chepkwony. 

These orders were issued to restrain the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) and the Inspector General of Police from arresting or harassing the Ramji family. 

The application was certified as urgent.

Court granted leave to the Ramjis to file a substantive judicial review application which allowed them to formally challenge the actions of the DCI and the Inspector General of Police.

The leave granted operated as a stay, meaning that any actions by the DCI or the Inspector General of Police to arrest or harass the Ramjis were temporarily halted pending the hearing and determination of the substantive judicial review 

The matter was set for mention on 20th June 2024 to confirm compliance with the court orders and to ensure that the judicial process was being followed correctly.

DCI and Inspector General of Police were given seven days upon service of the court orders to file their response to the judicial review application.

Despite having been served with orders restraining the arrest via Kiambu High Court Judicial Review Case No. HCJR/E010/2024, Wilhelm K. Kimutai (emboldened by his connections and a misplaced sense of invincibility) continued his campaign of harassment, ignoring the High Court's orders and further complicating the Ramji family's efforts to reclaim their property.

In their detailed judgment, the Court of Appeal judges found substantial flaws in the initial trial court's handling of the case.

They pointed out several key misdirections.

The appellate court noted that the trial judge had disregarded crucial evidence regarding the assignment of the suit property from Golden Terrace to the Ramjis.

""The learned judge failed to appreciate and give effect to the provisions of section 23 (1) of the Registration of Titles Act,"" the Court of Appeal stated.

The Court of Appeal also underscored the indefensibility of the Ramjis' title, stating, ""There was no dispute that they were the registered proprietors of the suit property."" The judges criticized the trial court for not recognizing this legal fact.

Addressing the clerical error in the transfer documents, the Court of Appeal clarified, ""It is obvious that there was a clerical error in the preparation of the transfer document in making reference to LR No. 11895/48 when the subject matter in the entire transfer was LR No. 11895/50.""",31,115,bullying detected

Episodes: 4
Airs: Jun 7, 2024 - Jun 28, 2024
Airs On: Friday
Original Network: One 31

Main Cast: Charlotte Austin , Engfa Waraha

Plot
In the era of social media, everyone can freely express their opinions about others. They can use harsh words without much consideration, not thinking about the consequences or verifying the truth.

In a relationship between two women, one becomes overly concerned with the opinions of others, making her vulnerable to someone she doesn't know who ends up hurting her. The second woman has never cared much, firmly believing in the adage ""to each their own."" However, at times, she can be remarkably oblivious to the feelings of those around her.

With their love in the spotlight, eyes across the nation scrutinise their every move, passing judgement on ever action.

"Remember when you were a kid - there was always that one kid who used to literally get away with everything. A kid could either talk their way out of trouble or had a few friends or parents in high places who would cover up their misadventures or bully others into ‚Äúforgetting‚Äù about it.

It amounted to zero consequences for the little zunt - and a fast developing attitude that they could literally go through life expecting no consequences for any actions.

Some of those kids might grow out of it after they‚Äôve ‚Äúlearned a lesson or two‚Äù - but others remain forever that little zunt who could do no wrong - and to accuse them of anything - regardless of their nefarious actions  - would result in everybody but them having a bad day.

I see it re-enacted over and over again in politics and business via people in positions of power - and by those who want that power and think that they deserve it, regardless of how undeserving they are. 

That little zunt literally destroys democracy because they have no respect for equality or fairness and they have no boundaries.

I can think of a few people like that. The more entitled they have been raised to be - or learned to be - and have gotten away with it - the more likely they are to be boundary free narcissists and sociopaths.

"#NarcissisticAbuse is a devastating form of emotional and psychological abuse caused by someone with high narcissistic traits. It involves a range of manipulative behaviors like gaslighting, blame-shifting, devaluation, and constant belittling and criticism that erodes your self-esteem.

They may alternate between being nice and cruel, leaving you in a constant state of anxiety, desperately seeking their approval. The victim may look like they are lying or crazy when they try to explain what‚Äôs going on because the narcissist‚Äôs two-faced nature is shamelessly hidden behind a mask of charm, lies, manipulation and smear campaigns.

"Theres this false narrative going around that I ‚Äúdefended Nick‚Äù & am therefore ‚Äúpro child neglect/abuse including drugs & swinging‚Äù. This false narrative has been repeated in my mentions for days all because I‚Äôm guilty of not immediately giving my opinion & condemning Nick. Every time I‚Äôve confronted someone accusing me of this I ask for them to provide me with one single receipt and they can‚Äôt because they don‚Äôt exist. You want to get mad because I‚Äôve been on stream with people who have opinions you do or don‚Äôt like & I didn‚Äôt say anything? Well newsflash I rarely chime in to topics I have zero desire to discuss. Just because others have opinions doesn‚Äôt mean I agree with them simply because I‚Äôm in their presence. I think water tastes disgusting; I‚Äôm in fully aware that 99.9% of the population disagrees & that‚Äôs fine. Just because you‚Äôre in my presence doesn‚Äôt mean you automatically share my views(crazy how that works right).

Now another accusation is that I‚Äôm ‚Äúdefending Nick‚Äù because I called out Aaron.  Idk if it‚Äôs willing ignorance or you‚Äôre just not intelligent enough to understand that just because you‚Äôve deemed one person the ultimate villain does not disqualify other monsters in the situation. Before all this started I didn‚Äôt know who tf this guy was. What I saw was a total sleezeball capitalizing on a situation for personal gain at the expense of children. My entire timeline was full of this jackass stirring the pot with disgusting sex stories that had nothing to actually do with the case but were just his ‚Äúinside scoop‚Äù for his 15minutes of fame. It absolutely disgusted me that someone could say the things he did stream after stream with a gigantic smile on his face. He knew those kids & claimed to care but was just a POS that didn‚Äôt do anything & yet still instead of helping them only continued to make their lives worse. They‚Äôre from a small town & this is a huge scandal. They‚Äôre already being judged by everyone around them & anyone including them can look up their last name & find any of the streams/clips of that jackass talking shit about their parents. Now if you still don‚Äôt understand why I would choose to call that shit out idk what to tell you this is something even Forest Gump would understand. 

Lastly all this situation has done has open my eyes to the amount of cancel culture pigs on my timeline. Every single one of you that accused me shit because I kept my opinions to myself are no better than the wackos that went after Gina or anyone else that steps out of line & doesn‚Äôt conform to your ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù. I‚Äôve seen your tweets & know who you are. All of you with the ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not with me then you‚Äôre my enemy‚Äù narrative should really take a step back and think about what you‚Äôre doing because It‚Äôs not good. Maybe take a minute & apply some common sense before demonizing me of ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù I didn‚Äôt commit or making accusations against me because I didn‚Äôt ‚Äústep in line‚Äù in the what you considered is a timely manner. Canceling me over your imaginary opinions won‚Äôt end well & forcing me to bend the knee to your will is only going to end in disappointment for you. I don‚Äôt put up with that kind of bs & I never will. 

At the end of the day my opinion on this really doesn‚Äôt matter nor will it change a single thing. Those kids have seen enough & me adding to it ultimately will not help. Everyone that actually knows me knows where I stand on this including Nick. Going after me with pitchforks because you want blood isn‚Äôt going to solve anything. It just exposes you cancel pigs for who you truly are.",34,606,bullying detected

"#NarcissisticAbuse is a devastating form of emotional and psychological abuse caused by someone with high narcissistic traits. It involves a range of manipulative behaviors like gaslighting, blame-shifting, devaluation, and constant belittling and criticism that erodes your self-esteem. The abuser will try to control and isolates you, cutting you off from support and making you feel dependent and powerless. They may alternate between being nice and cruel, leaving you in a constant state of anxiety, desperately seeking their approval. The victim may look like they are lying or crazy when they try to explain what‚Äôs going on because the narcissist‚Äôs two-faced nature is shamelessly hidden behind a mask of charm, lies, manipulation and smear campaigns. This kind of abuse can lead to serious emotional damage, including anxiety, depression, a loss of self-worth, and in extreme cases, C-PTSD, self medication, or suicide. It could be described as covert psychological violence.",255,563,bullying detected

"Long post warning üö® 

I think I‚Äôve figured out why I‚Äôm so turned off with the current left: they have become the establishment. 

Growing up the Republican Party, with its oppressive brand of moral conservatism, felt like the owners of the ‚Äúestablishment.‚Äù

The hippies and the left were a reaction to that. Free love, rock and roll, anti-war, anti-establishment.  That was followed by punk rock culture ‚Äî liberals continued to be the standard bearers of the antiestablishment. 

Even into the 90s/2000s, you had anti-war liberals pushing back against the Falwell moral majority and protesting the Iraq war (that was me üëã).  Then the pushback to the disastrous neocon political movement of the post-9/11 2000s. 

Then it all started to change. Trump in 2016 flipped everything on its head. Suddenly republicans were much less hawkish, ignoring foreign wars. and the liberals lost their mind with TDS. So everything then became a reaction to trump. 

Then covid hit and things really got weird. 

Liberals started pushing for even greater state control. Forced closures of businesses, executive orders, vaccine mandates, clamping down on constitutional rights. 

And they also started cheering US military action abroad in the Ukraine. Obama started this with his love for drone warfare. Now we see the left cheering the political prosecution of their political opponents. Grim. 

So now, all the sudden, the anti-establishment left of the last 60 years has swung hard to become the people they‚Äôve fought against.

Episodes: 4
Airs: Jun 7, 2024 - Jun 28, 2024

Original Network: One 31

Main Cast: Charlotte Austin , Engfa Waraha

Plot
In the era of social media, everyone can freely express their opinions about others. They can use harsh words without much consideration, not thinking about the consequences or verifying the truth.

In a relationship between two women, one becomes overly concerned with the opinions of others, making her vulnerable to someone she doesn't know who ends up hurting her. The second woman has never cared much, firmly believing in the adage ""to each their own."" However, at times, she can be remarkably oblivious to the feelings of those around her.

With their love in the spotlight, eyes across the nation scrutinise their every move, passing judgement on ever action.

Every time I‚Äôve confronted someone accusing me of this I ask for them to provide me with one single receipt and they can‚Äôt because they don‚Äôt exist. You want to get mad because I‚Äôve been on stream with people who have opinions you do or don‚Äôt like & I didn‚Äôt say anything? Well newsflash I rarely chime in to topics I have zero desire to discuss. Just because others have opinions doesn‚Äôt mean I agree with them simply because I‚Äôm in their presence. I think water tastes disgusting; I‚Äôm in fully aware that 99.9% of the population disagrees & that‚Äôs fine. Just because you‚Äôre in my presence doesn‚Äôt mean you automatically share my views(crazy how that works right).

Now another accusation is that I‚Äôm ‚Äúdefending Nick‚Äù because I called out Aaron.  Idk if it‚Äôs willing ignorance or you‚Äôre just not intelligent enough to understand that just because you‚Äôve deemed one person the ultimate villain does not disqualify other monsters in the situation. Before all this started I didn‚Äôt know who tf this guy was. What I saw was a total sleezeball capitalizing on a situation for personal gain at the expense of children. My entire timeline was full of this jackass stirring the pot with disgusting sex stories that had nothing to actually do with the case but were just his ‚Äúinside scoop‚Äù for his 15minutes of fame. It absolutely disgusted me that someone could say the things he did stream after stream with a gigantic smile on his face. He knew those kids & claimed to care but was just a POS that didn‚Äôt do anything & yet still instead of helping them only continued to make their lives worse. They‚Äôre from a small town & this is a huge scandal. They‚Äôre already being judged by everyone around them & anyone including them can look up their last name & find any of the streams/clips of that jackass talking shit about their parents. Now if you still don‚Äôt understand why I would choose to call that shit out idk what to tell you this is something even Forest Gump would understand. 

Lastly all this situation has done has open my eyes to the amount of cancel culture pigs on my timeline. Every single one of you that accused me shit because I kept my opinions to myself are no better than the wackos that went after Gina or anyone else that steps out of line & doesn‚Äôt conform to your ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù. I‚Äôve seen your tweets & know who you are. All of you with the ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not with me then you‚Äôre my enemy‚Äù narrative should really take a step back and think about what you‚Äôre doing because It‚Äôs not good. Maybe take a minute & apply some common sense before demonizing me of ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù I didn‚Äôt commit or making accusations against me because I didn‚Äôt ‚Äústep in line‚Äù in the what you considered is a timely manner. Canceling me over your imaginary opinions won‚Äôt end well & forcing me to bend the knee to your will is only going to end in disappointment for you. I don‚Äôt put up with that kind of bs & I never will. 

At the end of the day my opinion on this really doesn‚Äôt matter nor will it change a single thing. Those kids have seen enough & me adding to it ultimately will not help.

"Glad to see Quaden is doing well after everything the poor kid endured from bullies...at school & online!

More context:
Quaden Bayles, an Australian indigenous boy, became the focus of a viral video in 2020. Quaden was born with achondroplasia, a form of dwarfism. 

The video, which gained global attention, was filmed by his mother, Yarraka Bayles, on February 19, 2020. It shows Quaden in a highly distressed state, crying uncontrollably in the back of a car after a day at school where he was bullied. 

The emotional intensity of the video is evident as Quaden expresses a desire to harm himself, saying, ‚ÄúI wish I could stab myself in the heart‚Äù and ‚ÄúGive me a knife, I want to k*ll myself‚Äù‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã.

Every time I‚Äôve confronted someone accusing me of this I ask for them to provide me with one single receipt and they can‚Äôt because they don‚Äôt exist. You want to get mad because I‚Äôve been on stream with people who have opinions you do or don‚Äôt like & I didn‚Äôt say anything? Well newsflash I rarely chime in to topics I have zero desire to discuss. Just because others have opinions doesn‚Äôt mean I agree with them simply because I‚Äôm in their presence. I think water tastes disgusting; I‚Äôm in fully aware that 99.9% of the population disagrees & that‚Äôs fine. Just because you‚Äôre in my presence doesn‚Äôt mean you automatically share my views(crazy how that works right).

Now another accusation is that I‚Äôm ‚Äúdefending Nick‚Äù because I called out Aaron.  Idk if it‚Äôs willing ignorance or you‚Äôre just not intelligent enough to understand that just because you‚Äôve deemed one person the ultimate villain does not disqualify other monsters in the situation. Before all this started I didn‚Äôt know who tf this guy was. What I saw was a total sleezeball capitalizing on a situation for personal gain at the expense of children. My entire timeline was full of this jackass stirring the pot with disgusting sex stories that had nothing to actually do with the case but were just his ‚Äúinside scoop‚Äù for his 15minutes of fame. It absolutely disgusted me that someone could say the things he did stream after stream with a gigantic smile on his face. He knew those kids & claimed to care but was just a POS that didn‚Äôt do anything & yet still instead of helping them only continued to make their lives worse. They‚Äôre from a small town & this is a huge scandal. They‚Äôre already being judged by everyone around them & anyone including them can look up their last name & find any of the streams/clips of that jackass talking shit about their parents. Now if you still don‚Äôt understand why I would choose to call that shit out idk what to tell you this is something even Forest Gump would understand. 

Lastly all this situation has done has open my eyes to the amount of cancel culture pigs on my timeline. Every single one of you that accused me shit because I kept my opinions to myself are no better than the wackos that went after Gina or anyone else that steps out of line & doesn‚Äôt conform to your ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù. I‚Äôve seen your tweets & know who you are. All of you with the ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not with me then you‚Äôre my enemy‚Äù narrative should really take a step back and think about what you‚Äôre doing because It‚Äôs not good. Maybe take a minute & apply some common sense before demonizing me of ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù I didn‚Äôt commit or making accusations against me because I didn‚Äôt ‚Äústep in line‚Äù in the what you considered is a timely manner. Canceling me over your imaginary opinions won‚Äôt end well & forcing me to bend the knee to your will is only going to end in disappointment for you. I don‚Äôt put up with that kind of bs & I never will. 

At the end of the day my opinion on this really doesn‚Äôt matter nor will it change a single thing. Those kids have seen enough & me adding to it ultimately will not help.

They may alternate between being nice and cruel, leaving you in a constant state of anxiety, desperately seeking their approval.

"Long post warning üö® 

I think I‚Äôve figured out why I‚Äôm so turned off with the current left: they have become the establishment. 

Growing up the Republican Party, with its oppressive brand of moral conservatism, felt like the owners of the ‚Äúestablishment.‚Äù

The hippies and the left were a reaction to that. Free love, rock and roll, anti-war, anti-establishment.  That was followed by punk rock culture ‚Äî liberals continued to be the standard bearers of the antiestablishment. 

Even into the 90s/2000s, you had anti-war liberals pushing back against the Falwell moral majority and protesting the Iraq war (that was me üëã).  Then the pushback to the disastrous neocon political movement of the post-9/11 2000s. 

Then it all started to change. Trump in 2016 flipped everything on its head. Suddenly republicans were much less hawkish, ignoring foreign wars. and the liberals lost their mind with TDS. So everything then became a reaction to trump. 

Then covid hit and things really got weird. 

Liberals started pushing for even greater state control. Forced closures of businesses, executive orders, vaccine mandates, clamping down on constitutional rights. 

And they also started cheering US military action abroad in the Ukraine. Obama started this with his love for drone warfare. Now we see the left cheering the political prosecution of their political opponents. Grim. 

So now, all the sudden, the anti-establishment left of the last 60 years has swung hard to become the people they‚Äôve fought against. 

And there‚Äôs nothing less punk rock than fighting for the establishment.",30,367,bullying detected

Episodes: 4
Airs: Jun 7, 2024 - Jun 28, 2024
Airs On: Friday
Original Network: One 31

Main Cast: Charlotte Austin , Engfa Waraha

Plot
In the era of social media, everyone can freely express their opinions about others. They can use harsh words without much consideration, not thinking about the consequences or verifying the truth.

In a relationship between two women, one becomes overly concerned with the opinions of others, making her vulnerable to someone she doesn't know who ends up hurting her. The second woman has never cared much, firmly believing in the adage ""to each their own."" However, at times, she can be remarkably oblivious to the feelings of those around her.

With their love in the spotlight, eyes across the nation scrutinise their every move, passing judgement on ever action.

They say it's ""bullying"" - to write a post about most powerful man in the world, who is trying to save Hamas, so that they'd continue m*rdering, r*ping and kidnapping Israelis.

Isn't it displaced suicidal ""empathy"" that @GadSaad is always talking about?

Powerful white rich man is trying to save horrific monsters from hell, because of his own selfish interests, but I am supposed to be sensitive to his special needs? 

Hamas said that October 7 was great success and they want to continue doing it. To m*rder innocent Israelis, including babies, children, to burn people alive, to ashes, so that it took weeks to identify. To r*pe women while slicing their breasts off and play football with body parts. But sure, the most important is to be kind to a person who wants all this to continue.

Speaking of people with disabilities, many of them were m*rdered, sla*ghtered, r*ped and kidnapped by Hamas.

Ruth Perez with her father Eric were brutally m*rdered by Hamas at music festival. Ruth couldn't walk or talk but music was her life. What kind of monsters don't have mercy for such an innocent disabled girl?

Kapshiter family - parents Dina and Evgeny, and children Alin and Ethan were brutally m*rdered by Hamas monsters, when trying to escape. Hamas savages saw that it is a family with kids in the car, why did they sla*ghter them?? Ethan was a kid with special needs. Alin's body was found in another location weeks after her parents and brother's bodies were found. What did the horrific monsters do to her before m*rdering?

Noya Dan, 13 years old, was autistic girl. Hamas savages dragged her and her grandmother to Gaza border, m*rdered them and dumped their bodies in the dirt.

I have many more examples.
I am thinking about all of them every day.
I can't stop writing about them.
I can't sleep at night.

And white rich supremacist Biden doesn't care. He wants Hamas to win, to recover, to continue. Me, my family, my friends, kids I work with - we all will be the next victims.

"Long post warning üö® 

I think I‚Äôve figured out why I‚Äôm so turned off with the current left: they have become the establishment. 

Growing up the Republican Party, with its oppressive brand of moral conservatism, felt like the owners of the ‚Äúestablishment.‚Äù

The hippies and the left were a reaction to that. Free love, rock and roll, anti-war, anti-establishment.  That was followed by punk rock culture ‚Äî liberals continued to be the standard bearers of the antiestablishment. 

Even into the 90s/2000s, you had anti-war liberals pushing back against the Falwell moral majority and protesting the Iraq war (that was me üëã).  Then the pushback to the disastrous neocon political movement of the post-9/11 2000s. 

Then it all started to change. Trump in 2016 flipped everything on its head. Suddenly republicans were much less hawkish, ignoring foreign wars. and the liberals lost their mind with TDS. So everything then became a reaction to trump. 

Then covid hit and things really got weird. 

Liberals started pushing for even greater state control. Forced closures of businesses, executive orders, vaccine mandates, clamping down on constitutional rights. 

And they also started cheering US military action abroad in the Ukraine. Obama started this with his love for drone warfare. Now we see the left cheering the political prosecution of their political opponents. Grim. 

So now, all the sudden, the anti-establishment left of the last 60 years has swung hard to become the people they‚Äôve fought against. 

And there‚Äôs nothing less punk rock than fighting for the establishment.",30,368,bullying detected

Episodes: 4
Airs: Jun 7, 2024 - Jun 28, 2024
Airs On: Friday
Original Network: One 31

Main Cast: Charlotte Austin , Engfa Waraha

Plot
In the era of social media, everyone can freely express their opinions about others. They can use harsh words without much consideration, not thinking about the consequences or verifying the truth.

In a relationship between two women, one becomes overly concerned with the opinions of others, making her vulnerable to someone she doesn't know who ends up hurting her. The second woman has never cared much, firmly believing in the adage ""to each their own."" However, at times, she can be remarkably oblivious to the feelings of those around her.

With their love in the spotlight, eyes across the nation scrutinise their every move, passing judgement on ever action.

"Theres this false narrative going around that I ‚Äúdefended Nick‚Äù & am therefore ‚Äúpro child neglect/abuse including drugs & swinging‚Äù. This false narrative has been repeated in my mentions for days all because I‚Äôm guilty of not immediately giving my opinion & condemning Nick. Every time I‚Äôve confronted someone accusing me of this I ask for them to provide me with one single receipt and they can‚Äôt because they don‚Äôt exist. You want to get mad because I‚Äôve been on stream with people who have opinions you do or don‚Äôt like & I didn‚Äôt say anything? Well newsflash I rarely chime in to topics I have zero desire to discuss. Just because others have opinions doesn‚Äôt mean I agree with them simply because I‚Äôm in their presence. I think water tastes disgusting; I‚Äôm in fully aware that 99.9% of the population disagrees & that‚Äôs fine. Just because you‚Äôre in my presence doesn‚Äôt mean you automatically share my views(crazy how that works right).

Now another accusation is that I‚Äôm ‚Äúdefending Nick‚Äù because I called out Aaron.  Idk if it‚Äôs willing ignorance or you‚Äôre just not intelligent enough to understand that just because you‚Äôve deemed one person the ultimate villain does not disqualify other monsters in the situation. Before all this started I didn‚Äôt know who tf this guy was. What I saw was a total sleezeball capitalizing on a situation for personal gain at the expense of children. My entire timeline was full of this jackass stirring the pot with disgusting sex stories that had nothing to actually do with the case but were just his ‚Äúinside scoop‚Äù for his 15minutes of fame. It absolutely disgusted me that someone could say the things he did stream after stream with a gigantic smile on his face. He knew those kids & claimed to care but was just a POS that didn‚Äôt do anything & yet still instead of helping them only continued to make their lives worse. They‚Äôre from a small town & this is a huge scandal. They‚Äôre already being judged by everyone around them & anyone including them can look up their last name & find any of the streams/clips of that jackass talking shit about their parents. Now if you still don‚Äôt understand why I would choose to call that shit out idk what to tell you this is something even Forest Gump would understand. 

Lastly all this situation has done has open my eyes to the amount of cancel culture pigs on my timeline. Every single one of you that accused me shit because I kept my opinions to myself are no better than the wackos that went after Gina or anyone else that steps out of line & doesn‚Äôt conform to your ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù. I‚Äôve seen your tweets & know who you are. All of you with the ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not with me then you‚Äôre my enemy‚Äù narrative should really take a step back and think about what you‚Äôre doing because It‚Äôs not good. Maybe take a minute & apply some common sense before demonizing me of ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù I didn‚Äôt commit or making accusations against me because I didn‚Äôt ‚Äústep in line‚Äù in the what you considered is a timely manner. Canceling me over your imaginary opinions won‚Äôt end well & forcing me to bend the knee to your will is only going to end in disappointment for you. I don‚Äôt put up with that kind of bs & I never will. 

At the end of the day my opinion on this really doesn‚Äôt matter nor will it change a single thing. Those kids have seen enough & me adding to it ultimately will not help. Everyone that actually knows me knows where I stand on this including Nick. Going after me with pitchforks because you want blood isn‚Äôt going to solve anything. It just exposes you cancel pigs for who you truly are.",34,622,bullying detected

It involves a range of manipulative behaviors like gaslighting, blame-shifting, devaluation, and constant belittling and criticism that erodes your self-esteem. The abuser will try to control and isolates you, cutting you off from support and making you feel dependent and powerless. They may alternate between being nice and cruel, leaving you in a constant state of anxiety, desperately seeking their approval. The victim may look like they are lying or crazy when they try to explain what‚Äôs going on because the narcissist‚Äôs two-faced nature is shamelessly hidden behind a mask of charm, lies, manipulation and smear campaigns. This kind of abuse can lead to serious emotional damage, including anxiety, depression, a loss of self-worth, and in extreme cases, C-PTSD, self medication, or suicide.

"Theres this false narrative going around that I ‚Äúdefended Nick‚Äù & am therefore ‚Äúpro child neglect/abuse including drugs & swinging‚Äù. This false narrative has been repeated in my mentions for days all because I‚Äôm guilty of not immediately giving my opinion & condemning Nick. Every time I‚Äôve confronted someone accusing me of this I ask for them to provide me with one single receipt and they can‚Äôt because they don‚Äôt exist. You want to get mad because I‚Äôve been on stream with people who have opinions you do or don‚Äôt like & I didn‚Äôt say anything? Well newsflash I rarely chime in to topics I have zero desire to discuss. Just because others have opinions doesn‚Äôt mean I agree with them simply because I‚Äôm in their presence. I think water tastes disgusting; I‚Äôm in fully aware that 99.9% of the population disagrees & that‚Äôs fine. Just because you‚Äôre in my presence doesn‚Äôt mean you automatically share my views(crazy how that works right).

Now another accusation is that I‚Äôm ‚Äúdefending Nick‚Äù because I called out Aaron.  Idk if it‚Äôs willing ignorance or you‚Äôre just not intelligent enough to understand that just because you‚Äôve deemed one person the ultimate villain does not disqualify other monsters in the situation. Before all this started I didn‚Äôt know who tf this guy was. What I saw was a total sleezeball capitalizing on a situation for personal gain at the expense of children. My entire timeline was full of this jackass stirring the pot with disgusting sex stories that had nothing to actually do with the case but were just his ‚Äúinside scoop‚Äù for his 15minutes of fame. It absolutely disgusted me that someone could say the things he did stream after stream with a gigantic smile on his face. He knew those kids & claimed to care but was just a POS that didn‚Äôt do anything & yet still instead of helping them only continued to make their lives worse. They‚Äôre from a small town & this is a huge scandal. They‚Äôre already being judged by everyone around them & anyone including them can look up their last name & find any of the streams/clips of that jackass talking shit about their parents. Now if you still don‚Äôt understand why I would choose to call that shit out idk what to tell you this is something even Forest Gump would understand. 

Lastly all this situation has done has open my eyes to the amount of cancel culture pigs on my timeline. Every single one of you that accused me shit because I kept my opinions to myself are no better than the wackos that went after Gina or anyone else that steps out of line & doesn‚Äôt conform to your ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù. I‚Äôve seen your tweets & know who you are. All of you with the ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not with me then you‚Äôre my enemy‚Äù narrative should really take a step back and think about what you‚Äôre doing because It‚Äôs not good. Maybe take a minute & apply some common sense before demonizing me of ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù I didn‚Äôt commit or making accusations against me because I didn‚Äôt ‚Äústep in line‚Äù in the what you considered is a timely manner. Canceling me over your imaginary opinions won‚Äôt end well & forcing me to bend the knee to your will is only going to end in disappointment for you. I don‚Äôt put up with that kind of bs & I never will. 

At the end of the day my opinion on this really doesn‚Äôt matter nor will it change a single thing. Those kids have seen enough & me adding to it ultimately will not help. Everyone that actually knows me knows where I stand on this including Nick. Going after me with pitchforks because you want blood isn‚Äôt going to solve anything. It just exposes you cancel pigs for who you truly are.",34,622,bullying detected

"#NarcissisticAbuse is a devastating form of emotional and psychological abuse caused by someone with high narcissistic traits. It involves a range of manipulative behaviors like gaslighting, blame-shifting, devaluation, and constant belittling and criticism that erodes your self-esteem. The abuser will try to control and isolates you, cutting you off from support and making you feel dependent and powerless. They may alternate between being nice and cruel, leaving you in a constant state of anxiety, desperately seeking their approval. The victim may look like they are lying or crazy when they try to explain what‚Äôs going on because the narcissist‚Äôs two-faced nature is shamelessly hidden behind a mask of charm, lies, manipulation and smear campaigns. This kind of abuse can lead to serious emotional damage, including anxiety, depression, a loss of self-worth, and in extreme cases, C-PTSD, self medication, or suicide. It could be described as covert psychological violence.",267,588,bullying detected

"Long post warning üö® 

I think I‚Äôve figured out why I‚Äôm so turned off with the current left: they have become the establishment. 

Growing up the Republican Party, with its oppressive brand of moral conservatism, felt like the owners of the ‚Äúestablishment.‚Äù

The hippies and the left were a reaction to that. Free love, rock and roll, anti-war, anti-establishment.  That was followed by punk rock culture ‚Äî liberals continued to be the standard bearers of the antiestablishment. 

Even into the 90s/2000s, you had anti-war liberals pushing back against the Falwell moral majority and protesting the Iraq war (that was me üëã).  Then the pushback to the disastrous neocon political movement of the post-9/11 2000s. 

Then it all started to change. Trump in 2016 flipped everything on its head. Suddenly republicans were much less hawkish, ignoring foreign wars. and the liberals lost their mind with TDS. So everything then became a reaction to trump. 

Then covid hit and things really got weird. 

Liberals started pushing for even greater state control. Forced closures of businesses, executive orders, vaccine mandates, clamping down on constitutional rights. 

And they also started cheering US military action abroad in the Ukraine. Obama started this with his love for drone warfare. Now we see the left cheering the political prosecution of their political opponents. Grim. 

So now, all the sudden, the anti-establishment left of the last 60 years has swung hard to become the people they‚Äôve fought against. 

And there‚Äôs nothing less punk rock than fighting for the establishment.",30,368,bullying detected

Episodes: 4
Airs: Jun 7, 2024 - Jun 28, 2024
Airs On: Friday
Original Network: One 31

Main Cast: Charlotte Austin , Engfa Waraha

Plot
In the era of social media, everyone can freely express their opinions about others. They can use harsh words without much consideration, not thinking about the consequences or verifying the truth.

In a relationship between two women, one becomes overly concerned with the opinions of others, making her vulnerable to someone she doesn't know who ends up hurting her. The second woman has never cared much, firmly believing in the adage ""to each their own."" However, at times, she can be remarkably oblivious to the feelings of those around her.

With their love in the spotlight, eyes across the nation scrutinise their every move, passing judgement on ever action.

"I received some hateful comments on my post about Biden. Apparently, I was cruel when I made remarks about his speech and said it made no sense. They say it's ""bullying"" - to write a post about most powerful man in the world, who is trying to save Hamas, so that they'd continue m*rdering, r*ping and kidnapping Israelis.

Isn't it displaced suicidal ""empathy"" that @GadSaad is always talking about?

Powerful white rich man is trying to save horrific monsters from hell, because of his own selfish interests, but I am supposed to be sensitive to his special needs? 

Hamas said that October 7 was great success and they want to continue doing it. To m*rder innocent Israelis, including babies, children, to burn people alive, to ashes, so that it took weeks to identify. To r*pe women while slicing their breasts off and play football with body parts. But sure, the most important is to be kind to a person who wants all this to continue.

Speaking of people with disabilities, many of them were m*rdered, sla*ghtered, r*ped and kidnapped by Hamas.

Ruth Perez with her father Eric were brutally m*rdered by Hamas at music festival. Ruth couldn't walk or talk but music was her life. What kind of monsters don't have mercy for such an innocent disabled girl?

Kapshiter family - parents Dina and Evgeny, and children Alin and Ethan were brutally m*rdered by Hamas monsters, when trying to escape. Hamas savages saw that it is a family with kids in the car, why did they sla*ghter them?? Ethan was a kid with special needs. Alin's body was found in another location weeks after her parents and brother's bodies were found. What did the horrific monsters do to her before m*rdering?

Noya Dan, 13 years old, was autistic girl. Hamas savages dragged her and her grandmother to Gaza border, m*rdered them and dumped their bodies in the dirt.

I have many more examples.
I am thinking about all of them every day.
I can't stop writing about them.
I can't sleep at night.

And white rich supremacist Biden doesn't care. He wants Hamas to win, to recover, to continue. Me, my family, my friends, kids I work with - we all will be the next victims. 

I was quiet about Biden for 8 months, hoping that maybe he cares, a bit. But no. He doesn't.

"Glad to see Quaden is doing well after everything the poor kid endured from bullies...at school & online!

More context:
Quaden Bayles, an Australian indigenous boy, became the focus of a viral video in 2020. Quaden was born with achondroplasia, a form of dwarfism. 

The video, which gained global attention, was filmed by his mother, Yarraka Bayles, on February 19, 2020. It shows Quaden in a highly distressed state, crying uncontrollably in the back of a car after a day at school where he was bullied. 

The emotional intensity of the video is evident as Quaden expresses a desire to harm himself, saying, ‚ÄúI wish I could stab myself in the heart‚Äù and ‚ÄúGive me a knife, I want to k*ll myself‚Äù‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã.

I think I‚Äôve figured out why I‚Äôm so turned off with the current left: they have become the establishment. 

Growing up the Republican Party, with its oppressive brand of moral conservatism, felt like the owners of the ‚Äúestablishment.‚Äù

The hippies and the left were a reaction to that. Free love, rock and roll, anti-war, anti-establishment.  That was followed by punk rock culture ‚Äî liberals continued to be the standard bearers of the antiestablishment. 

Even into the 90s/2000s, you had anti-war liberals pushing back against the Falwell moral majority and protesting the Iraq war (that was me üëã).  Then the pushback to the disastrous neocon political movement of the post-9/11 2000s. 

Then it all started to change. Trump in 2016 flipped everything on its head. Suddenly republicans were much less hawkish, ignoring foreign wars. and the liberals lost their mind with TDS. So everything then became a reaction to trump. 

Then covid hit and things really got weird. 

Liberals started pushing for even greater state control. Forced closures of businesses, executive orders, vaccine mandates, clamping down on constitutional rights. 

And they also started cheering US military action abroad in the Ukraine. Obama started this with his love for drone warfare. Now we see the left cheering the political prosecution of their political opponents. Grim.

Episodes: 4
Airs: Jun 7, 2024 - Jun 28, 2024
Airs On: Friday
Original Network: One 31

Main Cast: Charlotte Austin , Engfa Waraha

Plot
In the era of social media, everyone can freely express their opinions about others. They can use harsh words without much consideration, not thinking about the consequences or verifying the truth.

In a relationship between two women, one becomes overly concerned with the opinions of others, making her vulnerable to someone she doesn't know who ends up hurting her. The second woman has never cared much, firmly believing in the adage ""to each their own."" However, at times, she can be remarkably oblivious to the feelings of those around her.

With their love in the spotlight, eyes across the nation scrutinise their every move, passing judgement on ever action.

I think I‚Äôve figured out why I‚Äôm so turned off with the current left: they have become the establishment. 

Growing up the Republican Party, with its oppressive brand of moral conservatism, felt like the owners of the ‚Äúestablishment.‚Äù

The hippies and the left were a reaction to that. Free love, rock and roll, anti-war, anti-establishment.  That was followed by punk rock culture ‚Äî liberals continued to be the standard bearers of the antiestablishment. 

Even into the 90s/2000s, you had anti-war liberals pushing back against the Falwell moral majority and protesting the Iraq war (that was me üëã).  Then the pushback to the disastrous neocon political movement of the post-9/11 2000s. 

Then it all started to change. Trump in 2016 flipped everything on its head. Suddenly republicans were much less hawkish, ignoring foreign wars. and the liberals lost their mind with TDS. So everything then became a reaction to trump. 

Then covid hit and things really got weird. 

Liberals started pushing for even greater state control. Forced closures of businesses, executive orders, vaccine mandates, clamping down on constitutional rights. 

And they also started cheering US military action abroad in the Ukraine. Obama started this with his love for drone warfare. Now we see the left cheering the political prosecution of their political opponents. Grim.

Episodes: 4
Airs: Jun 7, 2024 - Jun 28, 2024
Airs On: Friday
Original Network: One 31

Main Cast: Charlotte Austin , Engfa Waraha

Plot
In the era of social media, everyone can freely express their opinions about others. They can use harsh words without much consideration, not thinking about the consequences or verifying the truth.

In a relationship between two women, one becomes overly concerned with the opinions of others, making her vulnerable to someone she doesn't know who ends up hurting her. The second woman has never cared much, firmly believing in the adage ""to each their own."" However, at times, she can be remarkably oblivious to the feelings of those around her.

With their love in the spotlight, eyes across the nation scrutinise their every move, passing judgement on ever action.

They say it's ""bullying"" - to write a post about most powerful man in the world, who is trying to save Hamas, so that they'd continue m*rdering, r*ping and kidnapping Israelis.

Isn't it displaced suicidal ""empathy"" that @GadSaad is always talking about?

Powerful white rich man is trying to save horrific monsters from hell, because of his own selfish interests, but I am supposed to be sensitive to his special needs? 

Hamas said that October 7 was great success and they want to continue doing it. To m*rder innocent Israelis, including babies, children, to burn people alive, to ashes, so that it took weeks to identify. To r*pe women while slicing their breasts off and play football with body parts. But sure, the most important is to be kind to a person who wants all this to continue.

Speaking of people with disabilities, many of them were m*rdered, sla*ghtered, r*ped and kidnapped by Hamas.

Ruth Perez with her father Eric were brutally m*rdered by Hamas at music festival. Ruth couldn't walk or talk but music was her life. What kind of monsters don't have mercy for such an innocent disabled girl?

Kapshiter family - parents Dina and Evgeny, and children Alin and Ethan were brutally m*rdered by Hamas monsters, when trying to escape. Hamas savages saw that it is a family with kids in the car, why did they sla*ghter them?? Ethan was a kid with special needs. Alin's body was found in another location weeks after her parents and brother's bodies were found. What did the horrific monsters do to her before m*rdering?

Noya Dan, 13 years old, was autistic girl. Hamas savages dragged her and her grandmother to Gaza border, m*rdered them and dumped their bodies in the dirt.

I have many more examples.
I am thinking about all of them every day.
I can't stop writing about them.
I can't sleep at night.

And white rich supremacist Biden doesn't care. He wants Hamas to win, to recover, to continue. Me, my family, my friends, kids I work with - we all will be the next victims.

"Theres this false narrative going around that I ‚Äúdefended Nick‚Äù & am therefore ‚Äúpro child neglect/abuse including drugs & swinging‚Äù. This false narrative has been repeated in my mentions for days all because I‚Äôm guilty of not immediately giving my opinion & condemning Nick. Every time I‚Äôve confronted someone accusing me of this I ask for them to provide me with one single receipt and they can‚Äôt because they don‚Äôt exist. You want to get mad because I‚Äôve been on stream with people who have opinions you do or don‚Äôt like & I didn‚Äôt say anything? Well newsflash I rarely chime in to topics I have zero desire to discuss. Just because others have opinions doesn‚Äôt mean I agree with them simply because I‚Äôm in their presence. I think water tastes disgusting; I‚Äôm in fully aware that 99.9% of the population disagrees & that‚Äôs fine. Just because you‚Äôre in my presence doesn‚Äôt mean you automatically share my views(crazy how that works right).

Now another accusation is that I‚Äôm ‚Äúdefending Nick‚Äù because I called out Aaron.  Idk if it‚Äôs willing ignorance or you‚Äôre just not intelligent enough to understand that just because you‚Äôve deemed one person the ultimate villain does not disqualify other monsters in the situation. Before all this started I didn‚Äôt know who tf this guy was. What I saw was a total sleezeball capitalizing on a situation for personal gain at the expense of children. My entire timeline was full of this jackass stirring the pot with disgusting sex stories that had nothing to actually do with the case but were just his ‚Äúinside scoop‚Äù for his 15minutes of fame. It absolutely disgusted me that someone could say the things he did stream after stream with a gigantic smile on his face. He knew those kids & claimed to care but was just a POS that didn‚Äôt do anything & yet still instead of helping them only continued to make their lives worse. They‚Äôre from a small town & this is a huge scandal. They‚Äôre already being judged by everyone around them & anyone including them can look up their last name & find any of the streams/clips of that jackass talking shit about their parents. Now if you still don‚Äôt understand why I would choose to call that shit out idk what to tell you this is something even Forest Gump would understand. 

Lastly all this situation has done has open my eyes to the amount of cancel culture pigs on my timeline. Every single one of you that accused me shit because I kept my opinions to myself are no better than the wackos that went after Gina or anyone else that steps out of line & doesn‚Äôt conform to your ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù. I‚Äôve seen your tweets & know who you are. All of you with the ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not with me then you‚Äôre my enemy‚Äù narrative should really take a step back and think about what you‚Äôre doing because It‚Äôs not good. Maybe take a minute & apply some common sense before demonizing me of ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù I didn‚Äôt commit or making accusations against me because I didn‚Äôt ‚Äústep in line‚Äù in the what you considered is a timely manner. Canceling me over your imaginary opinions won‚Äôt end well & forcing me to bend the knee to your will is only going to end in disappointment for you. I don‚Äôt put up with that kind of bs & I never will. 

At the end of the day my opinion on this really doesn‚Äôt matter nor will it change a single thing. Those kids have seen enough & me adding to it ultimately will not help. Everyone that actually knows me knows where I stand on this including Nick. Going after me with pitchforks because you want blood isn‚Äôt going to solve anything. It just exposes you cancel pigs for who you truly are.",34,627,bullying detected

"#NarcissisticAbuse is a devastating form of emotional and psychological abuse caused by someone with high narcissistic traits. It involves a range of manipulative behaviors like gaslighting, blame-shifting, devaluation, and constant belittling and criticism that erodes your self-esteem. The abuser will try to control and isolates you, cutting you off from support and making you feel dependent and powerless. They may alternate between being nice and cruel, leaving you in a constant state of anxiety, desperately seeking their approval. The victim may look like they are lying or crazy when they try to explain what‚Äôs going on because the narcissist‚Äôs two-faced nature is shamelessly hidden behind a mask of charm, lies, manipulation and smear campaigns. This kind of abuse can lead to serious emotional damage, including anxiety, depression, a loss of self-worth, and in extreme cases, C-PTSD, self medication, or suicide. It could be described as covert psychological violence.",267,589,bullying detected

"Long post warning üö® 

I think I‚Äôve figured out why I‚Äôm so turned off with the current left: they have become the establishment. 

Growing up the Republican Party, with its oppressive brand of moral conservatism, felt like the owners of the ‚Äúestablishment.‚Äù

The hippies and the left were a reaction to that. Free love, rock and roll, anti-war, anti-establishment.  That was followed by punk rock culture ‚Äî liberals continued to be the standard bearers of the antiestablishment. 

Even into the 90s/2000s, you had anti-war liberals pushing back against the Falwell moral majority and protesting the Iraq war (that was me üëã).  Then the pushback to the disastrous neocon political movement of the post-9/11 2000s. 

Then it all started to change. Trump in 2016 flipped everything on its head. Suddenly republicans were much less hawkish, ignoring foreign wars. and the liberals lost their mind with TDS. So everything then became a reaction to trump. 

Then covid hit and things really got weird. 

Liberals started pushing for even greater state control. Forced closures of businesses, executive orders, vaccine mandates, clamping down on constitutional rights. 

And they also started cheering US military action abroad in the Ukraine. Obama started this with his love for drone warfare. Now we see the left cheering the political prosecution of their political opponents. Grim. 

So now, all the sudden, the anti-establishment left of the last 60 years has swung hard to become the people they‚Äôve fought against. 

And there‚Äôs nothing less punk rock than fighting for the establishment.",30,371,bullying detected

"10. Club Friday Season 16: Love Bully (2024)

Episodes: 4
Airs: Jun 7, 2024 - Jun 28, 2024
Airs On: Friday
Original Network: One 31

Main Cast: Charlotte Austin , Engfa Waraha

Plot
In the era of social media, everyone can freely express their opinions about others. They can use harsh words without much consideration, not thinking about the consequences or verifying the truth.

In a relationship between two women, one becomes overly concerned with the opinions of others, making her vulnerable to someone she doesn't know who ends up hurting her. The second woman has never cared much, firmly believing in the adage ""to each their own."" However, at times, she can be remarkably oblivious to the feelings of those around her.

With their love in the spotlight, eyes across the nation scrutinise their every move, passing judgement on ever action.

"Theres this false narrative going around that I ‚Äúdefended Nick‚Äù & am therefore ‚Äúpro child neglect/abuse including drugs & swinging‚Äù. This false narrative has been repeated in my mentions for days all because I‚Äôm guilty of not immediately giving my opinion & condemning Nick. Every time I‚Äôve confronted someone accusing me of this I ask for them to provide me with one single receipt and they can‚Äôt because they don‚Äôt exist. You want to get mad because I‚Äôve been on stream with people who have opinions you do or don‚Äôt like & I didn‚Äôt say anything? Well newsflash I rarely chime in to topics I have zero desire to discuss. Just because others have opinions doesn‚Äôt mean I agree with them simply because I‚Äôm in their presence. I think water tastes disgusting; I‚Äôm in fully aware that 99.9% of the population disagrees & that‚Äôs fine. Just because you‚Äôre in my presence doesn‚Äôt mean you automatically share my views(crazy how that works right).

Now another accusation is that I‚Äôm ‚Äúdefending Nick‚Äù because I called out Aaron.  Idk if it‚Äôs willing ignorance or you‚Äôre just not intelligent enough to understand that just because you‚Äôve deemed one person the ultimate villain does not disqualify other monsters in the situation. Before all this started I didn‚Äôt know who tf this guy was. What I saw was a total sleezeball capitalizing on a situation for personal gain at the expense of children. My entire timeline was full of this jackass stirring the pot with disgusting sex stories that had nothing to actually do with the case but were just his ‚Äúinside scoop‚Äù for his 15minutes of fame. It absolutely disgusted me that someone could say the things he did stream after stream with a gigantic smile on his face. He knew those kids & claimed to care but was just a POS that didn‚Äôt do anything & yet still instead of helping them only continued to make their lives worse. They‚Äôre from a small town & this is a huge scandal. They‚Äôre already being judged by everyone around them & anyone including them can look up their last name & find any of the streams/clips of that jackass talking shit about their parents. Now if you still don‚Äôt understand why I would choose to call that shit out idk what to tell you this is something even Forest Gump would understand. 

Lastly all this situation has done has open my eyes to the amount of cancel culture pigs on my timeline. Every single one of you that accused me shit because I kept my opinions to myself are no better than the wackos that went after Gina or anyone else that steps out of line & doesn‚Äôt conform to your ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù. I‚Äôve seen your tweets & know who you are. All of you with the ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not with me then you‚Äôre my enemy‚Äù narrative should really take a step back and think about what you‚Äôre doing because It‚Äôs not good. Maybe take a minute & apply some common sense before demonizing me of ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù I didn‚Äôt commit or making accusations against me because I didn‚Äôt ‚Äústep in line‚Äù in the what you considered is a timely manner. Canceling me over your imaginary opinions won‚Äôt end well & forcing me to bend the knee to your will is only going to end in disappointment for you. I don‚Äôt put up with that kind of bs & I never will. 

At the end of the day my opinion on this really doesn‚Äôt matter nor will it change a single thing. Those kids have seen enough & me adding to it ultimately will not help. Everyone that actually knows me knows where I stand on this including Nick. Going after me with pitchforks because you want blood isn‚Äôt going to solve anything. It just exposes you cancel pigs for who you truly are.",37,656,bullying detected

"Glad to see Quaden is doing well after everything the poor kid endured from bullies...at school & online!

More context:
Quaden Bayles, an Australian indigenous boy, became the focus of a viral video in 2020. Quaden was born with achondroplasia, a form of dwarfism. 

The video, which gained global attention, was filmed by his mother, Yarraka Bayles, on February 19, 2020. It shows Quaden in a highly distressed state, crying uncontrollably in the back of a car after a day at school where he was bullied. 

The emotional intensity of the video is evident as Quaden expresses a desire to harm himself, saying, ‚ÄúI wish I could stab myself in the heart‚Äù and ‚ÄúGive me a knife, I want to k*ll myself‚Äù‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã.

This video resonated with millions around the world, highlighting the severe impact of bullying on young individuals, particularly those with physical differences.

They say it's ""bullying"" - to write a post about most powerful man in the world, who is trying to save Hamas, so that they'd continue m*rdering, r*ping and kidnapping Israelis.

Isn't it displaced suicidal ""empathy"" that @GadSaad is always talking about?

Powerful white rich man is trying to save horrific monsters from hell, because of his own selfish interests, but I am supposed to be sensitive to his special needs? 

Hamas said that October 7 was great success and they want to continue doing it. To m*rder innocent Israelis, including babies, children, to burn people alive, to ashes, so that it took weeks to identify. To r*pe women while slicing their breasts off and play football with body parts. But sure, the most important is to be kind to a person who wants all this to continue.

Speaking of people with disabilities, many of them were m*rdered, sla*ghtered, r*ped and kidnapped by Hamas.

Ruth Perez with her father Eric were brutally m*rdered by Hamas at music festival. Ruth couldn't walk or talk but music was her life. What kind of monsters don't have mercy for such an innocent disabled girl?

Kapshiter family - parents Dina and Evgeny, and children Alin and Ethan were brutally m*rdered by Hamas monsters, when trying to escape. Hamas savages saw that it is a family with kids in the car, why did they sla*ghter them?? Ethan was a kid with special needs. Alin's body was found in another location weeks after her parents and brother's bodies were found. What did the horrific monsters do to her before m*rdering?

Noya Dan, 13 years old, was autistic girl. Hamas savages dragged her and her grandmother to Gaza border, m*rdered them and dumped their bodies in the dirt.

I have many more examples.
I am thinking about all of them every day.
I can't stop writing about them.
I can't sleep at night.

And white rich supremacist Biden doesn't care. He wants Hamas to win, to recover, to continue. Me, my family, my friends, kids I work with - we all will be the next victims. 

I was quiet about Biden for 8 months, hoping that maybe he cares, a bit. But no. He doesn't.

"Long post warning üö® 

I think I‚Äôve figured out why I‚Äôm so turned off with the current left: they have become the establishment. 

Growing up the Republican Party, with its oppressive brand of moral conservatism, felt like the owners of the ‚Äúestablishment.‚Äù

The hippies and the left were a reaction to that. Free love, rock and roll, anti-war, anti-establishment.  That was followed by punk rock culture ‚Äî liberals continued to be the standard bearers of the antiestablishment. 

Even into the 90s/2000s, you had anti-war liberals pushing back against the Falwell moral majority and protesting the Iraq war (that was me üëã).  Then the pushback to the disastrous neocon political movement of the post-9/11 2000s. 

Then it all started to change. Trump in 2016 flipped everything on its head. Suddenly republicans were much less hawkish, ignoring foreign wars. and the liberals lost their mind with TDS. So everything then became a reaction to trump. 

Then covid hit and things really got weird. 

Liberals started pushing for even greater state control. Forced closures of businesses, executive orders, vaccine mandates, clamping down on constitutional rights. 

And they also started cheering US military action abroad in the Ukraine. Obama started this with his love for drone warfare. Now we see the left cheering the political prosecution of their political opponents. Grim. 

So now, all the sudden, the anti-establishment left of the last 60 years has swung hard to become the people they‚Äôve fought against. 

And there‚Äôs nothing less punk rock than fighting for the establishment.",30,371,bullying detected

Episodes: 4
Airs: Jun 7, 2024 - Jun 28, 2024
Airs On: Friday
Original Network: One 31

Main Cast: Charlotte Austin , Engfa Waraha

Plot
In the era of social media, everyone can freely express their opinions about others. They can use harsh words without much consideration, not thinking about the consequences or verifying the truth.

In a relationship between two women, one becomes overly concerned with the opinions of others, making her vulnerable to someone she doesn't know who ends up hurting her. The second woman has never cared much, firmly believing in the adage ""to each their own."" However, at times, she can be remarkably oblivious to the feelings of those around her.

With their love in the spotlight, eyes across the nation scrutinise their every move, passing judgement on ever action.

"Theres this false narrative going around that I ‚Äúdefended Nick‚Äù & am therefore ‚Äúpro child neglect/abuse including drugs & swinging‚Äù. This false narrative has been repeated in my mentions for days all because I‚Äôm guilty of not immediately giving my opinion & condemning Nick. Every time I‚Äôve confronted someone accusing me of this I ask for them to provide me with one single receipt and they can‚Äôt because they don‚Äôt exist. You want to get mad because I‚Äôve been on stream with people who have opinions you do or don‚Äôt like & I didn‚Äôt say anything? Well newsflash I rarely chime in to topics I have zero desire to discuss. Just because others have opinions doesn‚Äôt mean I agree with them simply because I‚Äôm in their presence. I think water tastes disgusting; I‚Äôm in fully aware that 99.9% of the population disagrees & that‚Äôs fine. Just because you‚Äôre in my presence doesn‚Äôt mean you automatically share my views(crazy how that works right).

Now another accusation is that I‚Äôm ‚Äúdefending Nick‚Äù because I called out Aaron.  Idk if it‚Äôs willing ignorance or you‚Äôre just not intelligent enough to understand that just because you‚Äôve deemed one person the ultimate villain does not disqualify other monsters in the situation. Before all this started I didn‚Äôt know who tf this guy was. What I saw was a total sleezeball capitalizing on a situation for personal gain at the expense of children. My entire timeline was full of this jackass stirring the pot with disgusting sex stories that had nothing to actually do with the case but were just his ‚Äúinside scoop‚Äù for his 15minutes of fame. It absolutely disgusted me that someone could say the things he did stream after stream with a gigantic smile on his face. He knew those kids & claimed to care but was just a POS that didn‚Äôt do anything & yet still instead of helping them only continued to make their lives worse. They‚Äôre from a small town & this is a huge scandal. They‚Äôre already being judged by everyone around them & anyone including them can look up their last name & find any of the streams/clips of that jackass talking shit about their parents. Now if you still don‚Äôt understand why I would choose to call that shit out idk what to tell you this is something even Forest Gump would understand. 

Lastly all this situation has done has open my eyes to the amount of cancel culture pigs on my timeline. Every single one of you that accused me shit because I kept my opinions to myself are no better than the wackos that went after Gina or anyone else that steps out of line & doesn‚Äôt conform to your ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù. I‚Äôve seen your tweets & know who you are. All of you with the ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not with me then you‚Äôre my enemy‚Äù narrative should really take a step back and think about what you‚Äôre doing because It‚Äôs not good. Maybe take a minute & apply some common sense before demonizing me of ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù I didn‚Äôt commit or making accusations against me because I didn‚Äôt ‚Äústep in line‚Äù in the what you considered is a timely manner. Canceling me over your imaginary opinions won‚Äôt end well & forcing me to bend the knee to your will is only going to end in disappointment for you. I don‚Äôt put up with that kind of bs & I never will. 

At the end of the day my opinion on this really doesn‚Äôt matter nor will it change a single thing. Those kids have seen enough & me adding to it ultimately will not help. Everyone that actually knows me knows where I stand on this including Nick. Going after me with pitchforks because you want blood isn‚Äôt going to solve anything. It just exposes you cancel pigs for who you truly are.",37,661,bullying detected

They say it's ""bullying"" - to write a post about most powerful man in the world, who is trying to save Hamas, so that they'd continue m*rdering, r*ping and kidnapping Israelis.

Isn't it displaced suicidal ""empathy"" that @GadSaad is always talking about?

Powerful white rich man is trying to save horrific monsters from hell, because of his own selfish interests, but I am supposed to be sensitive to his special needs? 

Hamas said that October 7 was great success and they want to continue doing it. To m*rder innocent Israelis, including babies, children, to burn people alive, to ashes, so that it took weeks to identify. To r*pe women while slicing their breasts off and play football with body parts. But sure, the most important is to be kind to a person who wants all this to continue.

Speaking of people with disabilities, many of them were m*rdered, sla*ghtered, r*ped and kidnapped by Hamas.

Ruth Perez with her father Eric were brutally m*rdered by Hamas at music festival. Ruth couldn't walk or talk but music was her life. What kind of monsters don't have mercy for such an innocent disabled girl?

Kapshiter family - parents Dina and Evgeny, and children Alin and Ethan were brutally m*rdered by Hamas monsters, when trying to escape. Hamas savages saw that it is a family with kids in the car, why did they sla*ghter them?? Ethan was a kid with special needs. Alin's body was found in another location weeks after her parents and brother's bodies were found. What did the horrific monsters do to her before m*rdering?

Noya Dan, 13 years old, was autistic girl. Hamas savages dragged her and her grandmother to Gaza border, m*rdered them and dumped their bodies in the dirt.

I have many more examples.
I am thinking about all of them every day.
I can't stop writing about them.
I can't sleep at night.

And white rich supremacist Biden doesn't care. He wants Hamas to win, to recover, to continue. Me, my family, my friends, kids I work with - we all will be the next victims.

"Long post warning üö® 

I think I‚Äôve figured out why I‚Äôm so turned off with the current left: they have become the establishment. 

Growing up the Republican Party, with its oppressive brand of moral conservatism, felt like the owners of the ‚Äúestablishment.‚Äù

The hippies and the left were a reaction to that. Free love, rock and roll, anti-war, anti-establishment.  That was followed by punk rock culture ‚Äî liberals continued to be the standard bearers of the antiestablishment. 

Even into the 90s/2000s, you had anti-war liberals pushing back against the Falwell moral majority and protesting the Iraq war (that was me üëã).  Then the pushback to the disastrous neocon political movement of the post-9/11 2000s. 

Then it all started to change. Trump in 2016 flipped everything on its head. Suddenly republicans were much less hawkish, ignoring foreign wars. and the liberals lost their mind with TDS. So everything then became a reaction to trump. 

Then covid hit and things really got weird. 

Liberals started pushing for even greater state control. Forced closures of businesses, executive orders, vaccine mandates, clamping down on constitutional rights. 

And they also started cheering US military action abroad in the Ukraine. Obama started this with his love for drone warfare. Now we see the left cheering the political prosecution of their political opponents. Grim. 

So now, all the sudden, the anti-establishment left of the last 60 years has swung hard to become the people they‚Äôve fought against.

Episodes: 4
Airs: Jun 7, 2024 - Jun 28, 2024
Airs On: Friday
Original Network: One 31

Main Cast: Charlotte Austin , Engfa Waraha

Plot
In the era of social media, everyone can freely express their opinions about others. They can use harsh words without much consideration, not thinking about the consequences or verifying the truth.

In a relationship between two women, one becomes overly concerned with the opinions of others, making her vulnerable to someone she doesn't know who ends up hurting her. The second woman has never cared much, firmly believing in the adage ""to each their own."" However, at times, she can be remarkably oblivious to the feelings of those around her.

With their love in the spotlight, eyes across the nation scrutinise their every move, passing judgement on ever action.

This false narrative has been repeated in my mentions for days all because I‚Äôm guilty of not immediately giving my opinion & condemning Nick. Every time I‚Äôve confronted someone accusing me of this I ask for them to provide me with one single receipt and they can‚Äôt because they don‚Äôt exist. You want to get mad because I‚Äôve been on stream with people who have opinions you do or don‚Äôt like & I didn‚Äôt say anything? Well newsflash I rarely chime in to topics I have zero desire to discuss. Just because others have opinions doesn‚Äôt mean I agree with them simply because I‚Äôm in their presence. I think water tastes disgusting; I‚Äôm in fully aware that 99.9% of the population disagrees & that‚Äôs fine. Just because you‚Äôre in my presence doesn‚Äôt mean you automatically share my views(crazy how that works right).

Now another accusation is that I‚Äôm ‚Äúdefending Nick‚Äù because I called out Aaron.  Idk if it‚Äôs willing ignorance or you‚Äôre just not intelligent enough to understand that just because you‚Äôve deemed one person the ultimate villain does not disqualify other monsters in the situation. Before all this started I didn‚Äôt know who tf this guy was. What I saw was a total sleezeball capitalizing on a situation for personal gain at the expense of children. My entire timeline was full of this jackass stirring the pot with disgusting sex stories that had nothing to actually do with the case but were just his ‚Äúinside scoop‚Äù for his 15minutes of fame. It absolutely disgusted me that someone could say the things he did stream after stream with a gigantic smile on his face. He knew those kids & claimed to care but was just a POS that didn‚Äôt do anything & yet still instead of helping them only continued to make their lives worse. They‚Äôre from a small town & this is a huge scandal. They‚Äôre already being judged by everyone around them & anyone including them can look up their last name & find any of the streams/clips of that jackass talking shit about their parents. Now if you still don‚Äôt understand why I would choose to call that shit out idk what to tell you this is something even Forest Gump would understand. 

Lastly all this situation has done has open my eyes to the amount of cancel culture pigs on my timeline. Every single one of you that accused me shit because I kept my opinions to myself are no better than the wackos that went after Gina or anyone else that steps out of line & doesn‚Äôt conform to your ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù. I‚Äôve seen your tweets & know who you are. All of you with the ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not with me then you‚Äôre my enemy‚Äù narrative should really take a step back and think about what you‚Äôre doing because It‚Äôs not good. Maybe take a minute & apply some common sense before demonizing me of ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù I didn‚Äôt commit or making accusations against me because I didn‚Äôt ‚Äústep in line‚Äù in the what you considered is a timely manner. Canceling me over your imaginary opinions won‚Äôt end well & forcing me to bend the knee to your will is only going to end in disappointment for you. I don‚Äôt put up with that kind of bs & I never will. 

At the end of the day my opinion on this really doesn‚Äôt matter nor will it change a single thing. Those kids have seen enough & me adding to it ultimately will not help. Everyone that actually knows me knows where I stand on this including Nick. Going after me with pitchforks because you want blood isn‚Äôt going to solve anything. It just exposes you cancel pigs for who you truly are.",37,675,bullying detected

Isn't it displaced suicidal ""empathy"" that @GadSaad is always talking about?

Powerful white rich man is trying to save horrific monsters from hell, because of his own selfish interests, but I am supposed to be sensitive to his special needs? 

Hamas said that October 7 was great success and they want to continue doing it. To m*rder innocent Israelis, including babies, children, to burn people alive, to ashes, so that it took weeks to identify. To r*pe women while slicing their breasts off and play football with body parts. But sure, the most important is to be kind to a person who wants all this to continue.

Speaking of people with disabilities, many of them were m*rdered, sla*ghtered, r*ped and kidnapped by Hamas.

Ruth Perez with her father Eric were brutally m*rdered by Hamas at music festival. Ruth couldn't walk or talk but music was her life. What kind of monsters don't have mercy for such an innocent disabled girl?

Kapshiter family - parents Dina and Evgeny, and children Alin and Ethan were brutally m*rdered by Hamas monsters, when trying to escape. Hamas savages saw that it is a family with kids in the car, why did they sla*ghter them?? Ethan was a kid with special needs. Alin's body was found in another location weeks after her parents and brother's bodies were found. What did the horrific monsters do to her before m*rdering?

Noya Dan, 13 years old, was autistic girl. Hamas savages dragged her and her grandmother to Gaza border, m*rdered them and dumped their bodies in the dirt.

I have many more examples.
I am thinking about all of them every day.
I can't stop writing about them.
I can't sleep at night.

And white rich supremacist Biden doesn't care. He wants Hamas to win, to recover, to continue. Me, my family, my friends, kids I work with - we all will be the next victims.

"Glad to see Quaden is doing well after everything the poor kid endured from bullies...at school & online!

More context:
Quaden Bayles, an Australian indigenous boy, became the focus of a viral video in 2020. Quaden was born with achondroplasia, a form of dwarfism. 

The video, which gained global attention, was filmed by his mother, Yarraka Bayles, on February 19, 2020. It shows Quaden in a highly distressed state, crying uncontrollably in the back of a car after a day at school where he was bullied. 

The emotional intensity of the video is evident as Quaden expresses a desire to harm himself, saying, ‚ÄúI wish I could stab myself in the heart‚Äù and ‚ÄúGive me a knife, I want to k*ll myself‚Äù‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã.

This video resonated with millions around the world, highlighting the severe impact of bullying on young individuals, particularly those with physical differences.

To make matters even worse, cyber bullies attacked the family and made false claims about Quaden's age.

This false narrative has been repeated in my mentions for days all because I‚Äôm guilty of not immediately giving my opinion & condemning Nick. Every time I‚Äôve confronted someone accusing me of this I ask for them to provide me with one single receipt and they can‚Äôt because they don‚Äôt exist. You want to get mad because I‚Äôve been on stream with people who have opinions you do or don‚Äôt like & I didn‚Äôt say anything? Well newsflash I rarely chime in to topics I have zero desire to discuss. Just because others have opinions doesn‚Äôt mean I agree with them simply because I‚Äôm in their presence. I think water tastes disgusting; I‚Äôm in fully aware that 99.9% of the population disagrees & that‚Äôs fine. Just because you‚Äôre in my presence doesn‚Äôt mean you automatically share my views(crazy how that works right).

Now another accusation is that I‚Äôm ‚Äúdefending Nick‚Äù because I called out Aaron.  Idk if it‚Äôs willing ignorance or you‚Äôre just not intelligent enough to understand that just because you‚Äôve deemed one person the ultimate villain does not disqualify other monsters in the situation. Before all this started I didn‚Äôt know who tf this guy was. What I saw was a total sleezeball capitalizing on a situation for personal gain at the expense of children. My entire timeline was full of this jackass stirring the pot with disgusting sex stories that had nothing to actually do with the case but were just his ‚Äúinside scoop‚Äù for his 15minutes of fame. It absolutely disgusted me that someone could say the things he did stream after stream with a gigantic smile on his face. He knew those kids & claimed to care but was just a POS that didn‚Äôt do anything & yet still instead of helping them only continued to make their lives worse. They‚Äôre from a small town & this is a huge scandal. They‚Äôre already being judged by everyone around them & anyone including them can look up their last name & find any of the streams/clips of that jackass talking shit about their parents. Now if you still don‚Äôt understand why I would choose to call that shit out idk what to tell you this is something even Forest Gump would understand. 

Lastly all this situation has done has open my eyes to the amount of cancel culture pigs on my timeline. Every single one of you that accused me shit because I kept my opinions to myself are no better than the wackos that went after Gina or anyone else that steps out of line & doesn‚Äôt conform to your ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù. I‚Äôve seen your tweets & know who you are. All of you with the ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not with me then you‚Äôre my enemy‚Äù narrative should really take a step back and think about what you‚Äôre doing because It‚Äôs not good. Maybe take a minute & apply some common sense before demonizing me of ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù I didn‚Äôt commit or making accusations against me because I didn‚Äôt ‚Äústep in line‚Äù in the what you considered is a timely manner. Canceling me over your imaginary opinions won‚Äôt end well & forcing me to bend the knee to your will is only going to end in disappointment for you. I don‚Äôt put up with that kind of bs & I never will. 

At the end of the day my opinion on this really doesn‚Äôt matter nor will it change a single thing. Those kids have seen enough & me adding to it ultimately will not help. Everyone that actually knows me knows where I stand on this including Nick. Going after me with pitchforks because you want blood isn‚Äôt going to solve anything.

"Long post warning üö® 

I think I‚Äôve figured out why I‚Äôm so turned off with the current left: they have become the establishment. 

Growing up the Republican Party, with its oppressive brand of moral conservatism, felt like the owners of the ‚Äúestablishment.‚Äù

The hippies and the left were a reaction to that. Free love, rock and roll, anti-war, anti-establishment.  That was followed by punk rock culture ‚Äî liberals continued to be the standard bearers of the antiestablishment. 

Even into the 90s/2000s, you had anti-war liberals pushing back against the Falwell moral majority and protesting the Iraq war (that was me üëã).  Then the pushback to the disastrous neocon political movement of the post-9/11 2000s. 

Then it all started to change. Trump in 2016 flipped everything on its head. Suddenly republicans were much less hawkish, ignoring foreign wars. and the liberals lost their mind with TDS. So everything then became a reaction to trump. 

Then covid hit and things really got weird. 

Liberals started pushing for even greater state control. Forced closures of businesses, executive orders, vaccine mandates, clamping down on constitutional rights. 

And they also started cheering US military action abroad in the Ukraine. Obama started this with his love for drone warfare. Now we see the left cheering the political prosecution of their political opponents. Grim. 

So now, all the sudden, the anti-establishment left of the last 60 years has swung hard to become the people they‚Äôve fought against. 

And there‚Äôs nothing less punk rock than fighting for the establishment.",30,371,bullying detected

Episodes: 4
Airs: Jun 7, 2024 - Jun 28, 2024
Airs On: Friday
Original Network: One 31

Main Cast: Charlotte Austin , Engfa Waraha

Plot
In the era of social media, everyone can freely express their opinions about others. They can use harsh words without much consideration, not thinking about the consequences or verifying the truth.

In a relationship between two women, one becomes overly concerned with the opinions of others, making her vulnerable to someone she doesn't know who ends up hurting her. The second woman has never cared much, firmly believing in the adage ""to each their own."" However, at times, she can be remarkably oblivious to the feelings of those around her.

With their love in the spotlight, eyes across the nation scrutinise their every move, passing judgement on ever action.

The abuser will try to control and isolates you, cutting you off from support and making you feel dependent and powerless. They may alternate between being nice and cruel, leaving you in a constant state of anxiety, desperately seeking their approval. The victim may look like they are lying or crazy when they try to explain what‚Äôs going on because the narcissist‚Äôs two-faced nature is shamelessly hidden behind a mask of charm, lies, manipulation and smear campaigns. This kind of abuse can lead to serious emotional damage, including anxiety, depression, a loss of self-worth, and in extreme cases, C-PTSD, self medication, or suicide. It could be described as covert psychological violence.",277,609,bullying detected

"Theres this false narrative going around that I ‚Äúdefended Nick‚Äù & am therefore ‚Äúpro child neglect/abuse including drugs & swinging‚Äù. This false narrative has been repeated in my mentions for days all because I‚Äôm guilty of not immediately giving my opinion & condemning Nick. Every time I‚Äôve confronted someone accusing me of this I ask for them to provide me with one single receipt and they can‚Äôt because they don‚Äôt exist. You want to get mad because I‚Äôve been on stream with people who have opinions you do or don‚Äôt like & I didn‚Äôt say anything? Well newsflash I rarely chime in to topics I have zero desire to discuss. Just because others have opinions doesn‚Äôt mean I agree with them simply because I‚Äôm in their presence. I think water tastes disgusting; I‚Äôm in fully aware that 99.9% of the population disagrees & that‚Äôs fine. Just because you‚Äôre in my presence doesn‚Äôt mean you automatically share my views(crazy how that works right).

Now another accusation is that I‚Äôm ‚Äúdefending Nick‚Äù because I called out Aaron.  Idk if it‚Äôs willing ignorance or you‚Äôre just not intelligent enough to understand that just because you‚Äôve deemed one person the ultimate villain does not disqualify other monsters in the situation. Before all this started I didn‚Äôt know who tf this guy was. What I saw was a total sleezeball capitalizing on a situation for personal gain at the expense of children. My entire timeline was full of this jackass stirring the pot with disgusting sex stories that had nothing to actually do with the case but were just his ‚Äúinside scoop‚Äù for his 15minutes of fame. It absolutely disgusted me that someone could say the things he did stream after stream with a gigantic smile on his face. He knew those kids & claimed to care but was just a POS that didn‚Äôt do anything & yet still instead of helping them only continued to make their lives worse. They‚Äôre from a small town & this is a huge scandal. They‚Äôre already being judged by everyone around them & anyone including them can look up their last name & find any of the streams/clips of that jackass talking shit about their parents. Now if you still don‚Äôt understand why I would choose to call that shit out idk what to tell you this is something even Forest Gump would understand. 

Lastly all this situation has done has open my eyes to the amount of cancel culture pigs on my timeline. Every single one of you that accused me shit because I kept my opinions to myself are no better than the wackos that went after Gina or anyone else that steps out of line & doesn‚Äôt conform to your ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù. I‚Äôve seen your tweets & know who you are. All of you with the ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not with me then you‚Äôre my enemy‚Äù narrative should really take a step back and think about what you‚Äôre doing because It‚Äôs not good. Maybe take a minute & apply some common sense before demonizing me of ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù I didn‚Äôt commit or making accusations against me because I didn‚Äôt ‚Äústep in line‚Äù in the what you considered is a timely manner. Canceling me over your imaginary opinions won‚Äôt end well & forcing me to bend the knee to your will is only going to end in disappointment for you. I don‚Äôt put up with that kind of bs & I never will. 

At the end of the day my opinion on this really doesn‚Äôt matter nor will it change a single thing. Those kids have seen enough & me adding to it ultimately will not help. Everyone that actually knows me knows where I stand on this including Nick. Going after me with pitchforks because you want blood isn‚Äôt going to solve anything. It just exposes you cancel pigs for who you truly are.",38,687,bullying detected

"Long post warning üö® 

I think I‚Äôve figured out why I‚Äôm so turned off with the current left: they have become the establishment. 

Growing up the Republican Party, with its oppressive brand of moral conservatism, felt like the owners of the ‚Äúestablishment.‚Äù

The hippies and the left were a reaction to that. Free love, rock and roll, anti-war, anti-establishment.  That was followed by punk rock culture ‚Äî liberals continued to be the standard bearers of the antiestablishment. 

Even into the 90s/2000s, you had anti-war liberals pushing back against the Falwell moral majority and protesting the Iraq war (that was me üëã).  Then the pushback to the disastrous neocon political movement of the post-9/11 2000s. 

Then it all started to change. Trump in 2016 flipped everything on its head. Suddenly republicans were much less hawkish, ignoring foreign wars. and the liberals lost their mind with TDS. So everything then became a reaction to trump. 

Then covid hit and things really got weird. 

Liberals started pushing for even greater state control. Forced closures of businesses, executive orders, vaccine mandates, clamping down on constitutional rights. 

And they also started cheering US military action abroad in the Ukraine. Obama started this with his love for drone warfare. Now we see the left cheering the political prosecution of their political opponents. Grim. 

So now, all the sudden, the anti-establishment left of the last 60 years has swung hard to become the people they‚Äôve fought against.

Episodes: 4
Airs: Jun 7, 2024 - Jun 28, 2024
Airs On: Friday
Original Network: One 31

Main Cast: Charlotte Austin , Engfa Waraha

Plot
In the era of social media, everyone can freely express their opinions about others. They can use harsh words without much consideration, not thinking about the consequences or verifying the truth.

In a relationship between two women, one becomes overly concerned with the opinions of others, making her vulnerable to someone she doesn't know who ends up hurting her. The second woman has never cared much, firmly believing in the adage ""to each their own."" However, at times, she can be remarkably oblivious to the feelings of those around her.

With their love in the spotlight, eyes across the nation scrutinise their every move, passing judgement on ever action.

They may alternate between being nice and cruel, leaving you in a constant state of anxiety, desperately seeking their approval. The victim may look like they are lying or crazy when they try to explain what‚Äôs going on because the narcissist‚Äôs two-faced nature is shamelessly hidden behind a mask of charm, lies, manipulation and smear campaigns.

More context:
Quaden Bayles, an Australian indigenous boy, became the focus of a viral video in 2020. Quaden was born with achondroplasia, a form of dwarfism. 

The video, which gained global attention, was filmed by his mother, Yarraka Bayles, on February 19, 2020. It shows Quaden in a highly distressed state, crying uncontrollably in the back of a car after a day at school where he was bullied. 

The emotional intensity of the video is evident as Quaden expresses a desire to harm himself, saying, ‚ÄúI wish I could stab myself in the heart‚Äù and ‚ÄúGive me a knife, I want to k*ll myself‚Äù‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã.

"Theres this false narrative going around that I ‚Äúdefended Nick‚Äù & am therefore ‚Äúpro child neglect/abuse including drugs & swinging‚Äù. This false narrative has been repeated in my mentions for days all because I‚Äôm guilty of not immediately giving my opinion & condemning Nick. Every time I‚Äôve confronted someone accusing me of this I ask for them to provide me with one single receipt and they can‚Äôt because they don‚Äôt exist. You want to get mad because I‚Äôve been on stream with people who have opinions you do or don‚Äôt like & I didn‚Äôt say anything? Well newsflash I rarely chime in to topics I have zero desire to discuss. Just because others have opinions doesn‚Äôt mean I agree with them simply because I‚Äôm in their presence. I think water tastes disgusting; I‚Äôm in fully aware that 99.9% of the population disagrees & that‚Äôs fine. Just because you‚Äôre in my presence doesn‚Äôt mean you automatically share my views(crazy how that works right).

Now another accusation is that I‚Äôm ‚Äúdefending Nick‚Äù because I called out Aaron.  Idk if it‚Äôs willing ignorance or you‚Äôre just not intelligent enough to understand that just because you‚Äôve deemed one person the ultimate villain does not disqualify other monsters in the situation. Before all this started I didn‚Äôt know who tf this guy was. What I saw was a total sleezeball capitalizing on a situation for personal gain at the expense of children. My entire timeline was full of this jackass stirring the pot with disgusting sex stories that had nothing to actually do with the case but were just his ‚Äúinside scoop‚Äù for his 15minutes of fame. It absolutely disgusted me that someone could say the things he did stream after stream with a gigantic smile on his face. He knew those kids & claimed to care but was just a POS that didn‚Äôt do anything & yet still instead of helping them only continued to make their lives worse. They‚Äôre from a small town & this is a huge scandal. They‚Äôre already being judged by everyone around them & anyone including them can look up their last name & find any of the streams/clips of that jackass talking shit about their parents. Now if you still don‚Äôt understand why I would choose to call that shit out idk what to tell you this is something even Forest Gump would understand. 

Lastly all this situation has done has open my eyes to the amount of cancel culture pigs on my timeline. Every single one of you that accused me shit because I kept my opinions to myself are no better than the wackos that went after Gina or anyone else that steps out of line & doesn‚Äôt conform to your ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù. I‚Äôve seen your tweets & know who you are. All of you with the ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not with me then you‚Äôre my enemy‚Äù narrative should really take a step back and think about what you‚Äôre doing because It‚Äôs not good. Maybe take a minute & apply some common sense before demonizing me of ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù I didn‚Äôt commit or making accusations against me because I didn‚Äôt ‚Äústep in line‚Äù in the what you considered is a timely manner. Canceling me over your imaginary opinions won‚Äôt end well & forcing me to bend the knee to your will is only going to end in disappointment for you. I don‚Äôt put up with that kind of bs & I never will. 

At the end of the day my opinion on this really doesn‚Äôt matter nor will it change a single thing. Those kids have seen enough & me adding to it ultimately will not help. Everyone that actually knows me knows where I stand on this including Nick. Going after me with pitchforks because you want blood isn‚Äôt going to solve anything. It just exposes you cancel pigs for who you truly are.",39,689,bullying detected

"Long post warning üö® 

I think I‚Äôve figured out why I‚Äôm so turned off with the current left: they have become the establishment. 

Growing up the Republican Party, with its oppressive brand of moral conservatism, felt like the owners of the ‚Äúestablishment.‚Äù

The hippies and the left were a reaction to that. Free love, rock and roll, anti-war, anti-establishment.  That was followed by punk rock culture ‚Äî liberals continued to be the standard bearers of the antiestablishment. 

Even into the 90s/2000s, you had anti-war liberals pushing back against the Falwell moral majority and protesting the Iraq war (that was me üëã).  Then the pushback to the disastrous neocon political movement of the post-9/11 2000s. 

Then it all started to change. Trump in 2016 flipped everything on its head. Suddenly republicans were much less hawkish, ignoring foreign wars. and the liberals lost their mind with TDS. So everything then became a reaction to trump. 

Then covid hit and things really got weird. 

Liberals started pushing for even greater state control. Forced closures of businesses, executive orders, vaccine mandates, clamping down on constitutional rights. 

And they also started cheering US military action abroad in the Ukraine. Obama started this with his love for drone warfare. Now we see the left cheering the political prosecution of their political opponents. Grim. 

So now, all the sudden, the anti-establishment left of the last 60 years has swung hard to become the people they‚Äôve fought against. 

And there‚Äôs nothing less punk rock than fighting for the establishment.",30,373,bullying detected

Episodes: 4
Airs: Jun 7, 2024 - Jun 28, 2024
Airs On: Friday
Original Network: One 31

Main Cast: Charlotte Austin , Engfa Waraha

Plot
In the era of social media, everyone can freely express their opinions about others. They can use harsh words without much consideration, not thinking about the consequences or verifying the truth.

In a relationship between two women, one becomes overly concerned with the opinions of others, making her vulnerable to someone she doesn't know who ends up hurting her. The second woman has never cared much, firmly believing in the adage ""to each their own."" However, at times, she can be remarkably oblivious to the feelings of those around her.

With their love in the spotlight, eyes across the nation scrutinise their every move, passing judgement on ever action.

"#NarcissisticAbuse is a devastating form of emotional and psychological abuse caused by someone with high narcissistic traits. It involves a range of manipulative behaviors like gaslighting, blame-shifting, devaluation, and constant belittling and criticism that erodes your self-esteem. The abuser will try to control and isolates you, cutting you off from support and making you feel dependent and powerless. They may alternate between being nice and cruel, leaving you in a constant state of anxiety, desperately seeking their approval. The victim may look like they are lying or crazy when they try to explain what‚Äôs going on because the narcissist‚Äôs two-faced nature is shamelessly hidden behind a mask of charm, lies, manipulation and smear campaigns. This kind of abuse can lead to serious emotional damage, including anxiety, depression, a loss of self-worth, and in extreme cases, C-PTSD, self medication, or suicide.

"Glad to see Quaden is doing well after everything the poor kid endured from bullies...at school & online!

More context:
Quaden Bayles, an Australian indigenous boy, became the focus of a viral video in 2020. Quaden was born with achondroplasia, a form of dwarfism. 

The video, which gained global attention, was filmed by his mother, Yarraka Bayles, on February 19, 2020. It shows Quaden in a highly distressed state, crying uncontrollably in the back of a car after a day at school where he was bullied. 

The emotional intensity of the video is evident as Quaden expresses a desire to harm himself, saying, ‚ÄúI wish I could stab myself in the heart‚Äù and ‚ÄúGive me a knife, I want to k*ll myself‚Äù‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã.

This video resonated with millions around the world, highlighting the severe impact of bullying on young individuals, particularly those with physical differences.

To make matters even worse, cyber bullies attacked the family and made false claims about Quaden's age.

"I received some hateful comments on my post about Biden. Apparently, I was cruel when I made remarks about his speech and said it made no sense. They say it's ""bullying"" - to write a post about most powerful man in the world, who is trying to save Hamas, so that they'd continue m*rdering, r*ping and kidnapping Israelis.

Isn't it displaced suicidal ""empathy"" that @GadSaad is always talking about?

Powerful white rich man is trying to save horrific monsters from hell, because of his own selfish interests, but I am supposed to be sensitive to his special needs? 

Hamas said that October 7 was great success and they want to continue doing it. To m*rder innocent Israelis, including babies, children, to burn people alive, to ashes, so that it took weeks to identify. To r*pe women while slicing their breasts off and play football with body parts. But sure, the most important is to be kind to a person who wants all this to continue.

Speaking of people with disabilities, many of them were m*rdered, sla*ghtered, r*ped and kidnapped by Hamas.

Ruth Perez with her father Eric were brutally m*rdered by Hamas at music festival. Ruth couldn't walk or talk but music was her life. What kind of monsters don't have mercy for such an innocent disabled girl?

Kapshiter family - parents Dina and Evgeny, and children Alin and Ethan were brutally m*rdered by Hamas monsters, when trying to escape. Hamas savages saw that it is a family with kids in the car, why did they sla*ghter them?? Ethan was a kid with special needs. Alin's body was found in another location weeks after her parents and brother's bodies were found. What did the horrific monsters do to her before m*rdering?

Noya Dan, 13 years old, was autistic girl. Hamas savages dragged her and her grandmother to Gaza border, m*rdered them and dumped their bodies in the dirt.

I have many more examples.
I am thinking about all of them every day.
I can't stop writing about them.
I can't sleep at night.

And white rich supremacist Biden doesn't care. He wants Hamas to win, to recover, to continue. Me, my family, my friends, kids I work with - we all will be the next victims. 

I was quiet about Biden for 8 months, hoping that maybe he cares, a bit. But no. He doesn't.

"Long post warning üö® 

I think I‚Äôve figured out why I‚Äôm so turned off with the current left: they have become the establishment. 

Growing up the Republican Party, with its oppressive brand of moral conservatism, felt like the owners of the ‚Äúestablishment.‚Äù

The hippies and the left were a reaction to that. Free love, rock and roll, anti-war, anti-establishment.  That was followed by punk rock culture ‚Äî liberals continued to be the standard bearers of the antiestablishment. 

Even into the 90s/2000s, you had anti-war liberals pushing back against the Falwell moral majority and protesting the Iraq war (that was me üëã).  Then the pushback to the disastrous neocon political movement of the post-9/11 2000s. 

Then it all started to change. Trump in 2016 flipped everything on its head. Suddenly republicans were much less hawkish, ignoring foreign wars. and the liberals lost their mind with TDS. So everything then became a reaction to trump. 

Then covid hit and things really got weird. 

Liberals started pushing for even greater state control. Forced closures of businesses, executive orders, vaccine mandates, clamping down on constitutional rights. 

And they also started cheering US military action abroad in the Ukraine. Obama started this with his love for drone warfare. Now we see the left cheering the political prosecution of their political opponents. Grim. 

So now, all the sudden, the anti-establishment left of the last 60 years has swung hard to become the people they‚Äôve fought against.

Episodes: 4
Airs: Jun 7, 2024 - Jun 28, 2024
Airs On: Friday
Original Network: One 31

Main Cast: Charlotte Austin , Engfa Waraha

Plot
In the era of social media, everyone can freely express their opinions about others. They can use harsh words without much consideration, not thinking about the consequences or verifying the truth.

In a relationship between two women, one becomes overly concerned with the opinions of others, making her vulnerable to someone she doesn't know who ends up hurting her. The second woman has never cared much, firmly believing in the adage ""to each their own."" However, at times, she can be remarkably oblivious to the feelings of those around her.

With their love in the spotlight, eyes across the nation scrutinise their every move, passing judgement on ever action.

Every time I‚Äôve confronted someone accusing me of this I ask for them to provide me with one single receipt and they can‚Äôt because they don‚Äôt exist. You want to get mad because I‚Äôve been on stream with people who have opinions you do or don‚Äôt like & I didn‚Äôt say anything? Well newsflash I rarely chime in to topics I have zero desire to discuss. Just because others have opinions doesn‚Äôt mean I agree with them simply because I‚Äôm in their presence. I think water tastes disgusting; I‚Äôm in fully aware that 99.9% of the population disagrees & that‚Äôs fine. Just because you‚Äôre in my presence doesn‚Äôt mean you automatically share my views(crazy how that works right).

Now another accusation is that I‚Äôm ‚Äúdefending Nick‚Äù because I called out Aaron.  Idk if it‚Äôs willing ignorance or you‚Äôre just not intelligent enough to understand that just because you‚Äôve deemed one person the ultimate villain does not disqualify other monsters in the situation. Before all this started I didn‚Äôt know who tf this guy was. What I saw was a total sleezeball capitalizing on a situation for personal gain at the expense of children. My entire timeline was full of this jackass stirring the pot with disgusting sex stories that had nothing to actually do with the case but were just his ‚Äúinside scoop‚Äù for his 15minutes of fame. It absolutely disgusted me that someone could say the things he did stream after stream with a gigantic smile on his face. He knew those kids & claimed to care but was just a POS that didn‚Äôt do anything & yet still instead of helping them only continued to make their lives worse. They‚Äôre from a small town & this is a huge scandal. They‚Äôre already being judged by everyone around them & anyone including them can look up their last name & find any of the streams/clips of that jackass talking shit about their parents. Now if you still don‚Äôt understand why I would choose to call that shit out idk what to tell you this is something even Forest Gump would understand. 

Lastly all this situation has done has open my eyes to the amount of cancel culture pigs on my timeline. Every single one of you that accused me shit because I kept my opinions to myself are no better than the wackos that went after Gina or anyone else that steps out of line & doesn‚Äôt conform to your ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù. I‚Äôve seen your tweets & know who you are. All of you with the ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not with me then you‚Äôre my enemy‚Äù narrative should really take a step back and think about what you‚Äôre doing because It‚Äôs not good. Maybe take a minute & apply some common sense before demonizing me of ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù I didn‚Äôt commit or making accusations against me because I didn‚Äôt ‚Äústep in line‚Äù in the what you considered is a timely manner. Canceling me over your imaginary opinions won‚Äôt end well & forcing me to bend the knee to your will is only going to end in disappointment for you. I don‚Äôt put up with that kind of bs & I never will. 

At the end of the day my opinion on this really doesn‚Äôt matter nor will it change a single thing. Those kids have seen enough & me adding to it ultimately will not help. Everyone that actually knows me knows where I stand on this including Nick. Going after me with pitchforks because you want blood isn‚Äôt going to solve anything.

"I received some hateful comments on my post about Biden. Apparently, I was cruel when I made remarks about his speech and said it made no sense. They say it's ""bullying"" - to write a post about most powerful man in the world, who is trying to save Hamas, so that they'd continue m*rdering, r*ping and kidnapping Israelis.

Isn't it displaced suicidal ""empathy"" that @GadSaad is always talking about?

Powerful white rich man is trying to save horrific monsters from hell, because of his own selfish interests, but I am supposed to be sensitive to his special needs? 

Hamas said that October 7 was great success and they want to continue doing it. To m*rder innocent Israelis, including babies, children, to burn people alive, to ashes, so that it took weeks to identify. To r*pe women while slicing their breasts off and play football with body parts. But sure, the most important is to be kind to a person who wants all this to continue.

Speaking of people with disabilities, many of them were m*rdered, sla*ghtered, r*ped and kidnapped by Hamas.

Ruth Perez with her father Eric were brutally m*rdered by Hamas at music festival. Ruth couldn't walk or talk but music was her life. What kind of monsters don't have mercy for such an innocent disabled girl?

Kapshiter family - parents Dina and Evgeny, and children Alin and Ethan were brutally m*rdered by Hamas monsters, when trying to escape. Hamas savages saw that it is a family with kids in the car, why did they sla*ghter them?? Ethan was a kid with special needs. Alin's body was found in another location weeks after her parents and brother's bodies were found. What did the horrific monsters do to her before m*rdering?

Noya Dan, 13 years old, was autistic girl. Hamas savages dragged her and her grandmother to Gaza border, m*rdered them and dumped their bodies in the dirt.

I have many more examples.
I am thinking about all of them every day.
I can't stop writing about them.
I can't sleep at night.

And white rich supremacist Biden doesn't care. He wants Hamas to win, to recover, to continue. Me, my family, my friends, kids I work with - we all will be the next victims. 

I was quiet about Biden for 8 months, hoping that maybe he cares, a bit. But no. He doesn't.

"Glad to see Quaden is doing well after everything the poor kid endured from bullies...at school & online!

More context:
Quaden Bayles, an Australian indigenous boy, became the focus of a viral video in 2020. Quaden was born with achondroplasia, a form of dwarfism. 

The video, which gained global attention, was filmed by his mother, Yarraka Bayles, on February 19, 2020. It shows Quaden in a highly distressed state, crying uncontrollably in the back of a car after a day at school where he was bullied. 

The emotional intensity of the video is evident as Quaden expresses a desire to harm himself, saying, ‚ÄúI wish I could stab myself in the heart‚Äù and ‚ÄúGive me a knife, I want to k*ll myself‚Äù‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã.

"Long post warning üö® 

I think I‚Äôve figured out why I‚Äôm so turned off with the current left: they have become the establishment. 

Growing up the Republican Party, with its oppressive brand of moral conservatism, felt like the owners of the ‚Äúestablishment.‚Äù

The hippies and the left were a reaction to that. Free love, rock and roll, anti-war, anti-establishment.  That was followed by punk rock culture ‚Äî liberals continued to be the standard bearers of the antiestablishment. 

Even into the 90s/2000s, you had anti-war liberals pushing back against the Falwell moral majority and protesting the Iraq war (that was me üëã).  Then the pushback to the disastrous neocon political movement of the post-9/11 2000s. 

Then it all started to change. Trump in 2016 flipped everything on its head. Suddenly republicans were much less hawkish, ignoring foreign wars. and the liberals lost their mind with TDS. So everything then became a reaction to trump. 

Then covid hit and things really got weird. 

Liberals started pushing for even greater state control. Forced closures of businesses, executive orders, vaccine mandates, clamping down on constitutional rights. 

And they also started cheering US military action abroad in the Ukraine. Obama started this with his love for drone warfare. Now we see the left cheering the political prosecution of their political opponents. Grim. 

So now, all the sudden, the anti-establishment left of the last 60 years has swung hard to become the people they‚Äôve fought against.

Episodes: 4
Airs: Jun 7, 2024 - Jun 28, 2024
Airs On: Friday
Original Network: One 31

Main Cast: Charlotte Austin , Engfa Waraha

Plot
In the era of social media, everyone can freely express their opinions about others. They can use harsh words without much consideration, not thinking about the consequences or verifying the truth.

In a relationship between two women, one becomes overly concerned with the opinions of others, making her vulnerable to someone she doesn't know who ends up hurting her. The second woman has never cared much, firmly believing in the adage ""to each their own."" However, at times, she can be remarkably oblivious to the feelings of those around her.

With their love in the spotlight, eyes across the nation scrutinise their every move, passing judgement on ever action.

You want to get mad because I‚Äôve been on stream with people who have opinions you do or don‚Äôt like & I didn‚Äôt say anything?

I think water tastes disgusting; I‚Äôm in fully aware that 99.9% of the population disagrees & that‚Äôs fine. Just because you‚Äôre in my presence doesn‚Äôt mean you automatically share my views(crazy how that works right).

Now another accusation is that I‚Äôm ‚Äúdefending Nick‚Äù because I called out Aaron.  Idk if it‚Äôs willing ignorance or you‚Äôre just not intelligent enough to understand that just because you‚Äôve deemed one person the ultimate villain does not disqualify other monsters in the situation.

It absolutely disgusted me that someone could say the things he did stream after stream with a gigantic smile on his face. He knew those kids & claimed to care but was just a POS that didn‚Äôt do anything & yet still instead of helping them only continued to make their lives worse. They‚Äôre from a small town & this is a huge scandal. They‚Äôre already being judged by everyone around them & anyone including them can look up their last name & find any of the streams/clips of that jackass talking shit about their parents. Now if you still don‚Äôt understand why I would choose to call that shit out idk what to tell you this is something even Forest Gump would understand. 

Lastly all this situation has done has open my eyes to the amount of cancel culture pigs on my timeline. Every single one of you that accused me shit because I kept my opinions to myself are no better than the wackos that went after Gina or anyone else that steps out of line & doesn‚Äôt conform to your ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù. I‚Äôve seen your tweets & know who you are. All of you with the ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not with me then you‚Äôre my enemy‚Äù narrative should really take a step back and think about what you‚Äôre doing because It‚Äôs not good.

Canceling me over your imaginary opinions won‚Äôt end well & forcing me to bend the knee to your will is only going to end in disappointment for you. I don‚Äôt put up with that kind of bs & I never will. 

At the end of the day my opinion on this really doesn‚Äôt matter nor will it change a single thing. Those kids have seen enough & me adding to it ultimately will not help.

They say it's ""bullying"" - to write a post about most powerful man in the world, who is trying to save Hamas, so that they'd continue m*rdering, r*ping and kidnapping Israelis.

Isn't it displaced suicidal ""empathy"" that @GadSaad is always talking about?

Powerful white rich man is trying to save horrific monsters from hell, because of his own selfish interests, but I am supposed to be sensitive to his special needs? 

Hamas said that October 7 was great success and they want to continue doing it. To m*rder innocent Israelis, including babies, children, to burn people alive, to ashes, so that it took weeks to identify. To r*pe women while slicing their breasts off and play football with body parts. But sure, the most important is to be kind to a person who wants all this to continue.

Speaking of people with disabilities, many of them were m*rdered, sla*ghtered, r*ped and kidnapped by Hamas.

Ruth Perez with her father Eric were brutally m*rdered by Hamas at music festival. Ruth couldn't walk or talk but music was her life. What kind of monsters don't have mercy for such an innocent disabled girl?

Kapshiter family - parents Dina and Evgeny, and children Alin and Ethan were brutally m*rdered by Hamas monsters, when trying to escape. Hamas savages saw that it is a family with kids in the car, why did they sla*ghter them?? Ethan was a kid with special needs. Alin's body was found in another location weeks after her parents and brother's bodies were found. What did the horrific monsters do to her before m*rdering?

Noya Dan, 13 years old, was autistic girl. Hamas savages dragged her and her grandmother to Gaza border, m*rdered them and dumped their bodies in the dirt.

I have many more examples.
I am thinking about all of them every day.
I can't stop writing about them.
I can't sleep at night.

And white rich supremacist Biden doesn't care. He wants Hamas to win, to recover, to continue. Me, my family, my friends, kids I work with - we all will be the next victims.

"Long post warning üö® 

I think I‚Äôve figured out why I‚Äôm so turned off with the current left: they have become the establishment. 

Growing up the Republican Party, with its oppressive brand of moral conservatism, felt like the owners of the ‚Äúestablishment.‚Äù

The hippies and the left were a reaction to that. Free love, rock and roll, anti-war, anti-establishment.  That was followed by punk rock culture ‚Äî liberals continued to be the standard bearers of the antiestablishment. 

Even into the 90s/2000s, you had anti-war liberals pushing back against the Falwell moral majority and protesting the Iraq war (that was me üëã).  Then the pushback to the disastrous neocon political movement of the post-9/11 2000s. 

Then it all started to change. Trump in 2016 flipped everything on its head. Suddenly republicans were much less hawkish, ignoring foreign wars. and the liberals lost their mind with TDS. So everything then became a reaction to trump. 

Then covid hit and things really got weird. 

Liberals started pushing for even greater state control. Forced closures of businesses, executive orders, vaccine mandates, clamping down on constitutional rights. 

And they also started cheering US military action abroad in the Ukraine. Obama started this with his love for drone warfare. Now we see the left cheering the political prosecution of their political opponents. Grim. 

So now, all the sudden, the anti-establishment left of the last 60 years has swung hard to become the people they‚Äôve fought against. 

And there‚Äôs nothing less punk rock than fighting for the establishment.",30,375,bullying detected

"10. Club Friday Season 16: Love Bully (2024)

Episodes: 4
Airs: Jun 7, 2024 - Jun 28, 2024
Airs On: Friday
Original Network: One 31

Main Cast: Charlotte Austin , Engfa Waraha

Plot
In the era of social media, everyone can freely express their opinions about others. They can use harsh words without much consideration, not thinking about the consequences or verifying the truth.

In a relationship between two women, one becomes overly concerned with the opinions of others, making her vulnerable to someone she doesn't know who ends up hurting her. The second woman has never cared much, firmly believing in the adage ""to each their own."" However, at times, she can be remarkably oblivious to the feelings of those around her.

With their love in the spotlight, eyes across the nation scrutinise their every move, passing judgement on ever action.

Every time I‚Äôve confronted someone accusing me of this I ask for them to provide me with one single receipt and they can‚Äôt because they don‚Äôt exist. You want to get mad because I‚Äôve been on stream with people who have opinions you do or don‚Äôt like & I didn‚Äôt say anything? Well newsflash I rarely chime in to topics I have zero desire to discuss. Just because others have opinions doesn‚Äôt mean I agree with them simply because I‚Äôm in their presence. I think water tastes disgusting; I‚Äôm in fully aware that 99.9% of the population disagrees & that‚Äôs fine. Just because you‚Äôre in my presence doesn‚Äôt mean you automatically share my views(crazy how that works right).

Now another accusation is that I‚Äôm ‚Äúdefending Nick‚Äù because I called out Aaron.  Idk if it‚Äôs willing ignorance or you‚Äôre just not intelligent enough to understand that just because you‚Äôve deemed one person the ultimate villain does not disqualify other monsters in the situation. Before all this started I didn‚Äôt know who tf this guy was. What I saw was a total sleezeball capitalizing on a situation for personal gain at the expense of children. My entire timeline was full of this jackass stirring the pot with disgusting sex stories that had nothing to actually do with the case but were just his ‚Äúinside scoop‚Äù for his 15minutes of fame. It absolutely disgusted me that someone could say the things he did stream after stream with a gigantic smile on his face. He knew those kids & claimed to care but was just a POS that didn‚Äôt do anything & yet still instead of helping them only continued to make their lives worse. They‚Äôre from a small town & this is a huge scandal. They‚Äôre already being judged by everyone around them & anyone including them can look up their last name & find any of the streams/clips of that jackass talking shit about their parents. Now if you still don‚Äôt understand why I would choose to call that shit out idk what to tell you this is something even Forest Gump would understand. 

Lastly all this situation has done has open my eyes to the amount of cancel culture pigs on my timeline. Every single one of you that accused me shit because I kept my opinions to myself are no better than the wackos that went after Gina or anyone else that steps out of line & doesn‚Äôt conform to your ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù. I‚Äôve seen your tweets & know who you are. All of you with the ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not with me then you‚Äôre my enemy‚Äù narrative should really take a step back and think about what you‚Äôre doing because It‚Äôs not good. Maybe take a minute & apply some common sense before demonizing me of ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù I didn‚Äôt commit or making accusations against me because I didn‚Äôt ‚Äústep in line‚Äù in the what you considered is a timely manner. Canceling me over your imaginary opinions won‚Äôt end well & forcing me to bend the knee to your will is only going to end in disappointment for you. I don‚Äôt put up with that kind of bs & I never will. 

At the end of the day my opinion on this really doesn‚Äôt matter nor will it change a single thing. Those kids have seen enough & me adding to it ultimately will not help. Everyone that actually knows me knows where I stand on this including Nick. Going after me with pitchforks because you want blood isn‚Äôt going to solve anything. It just exposes you cancel pigs for who you truly are.",41,696,bullying detected

More context:
Quaden Bayles, an Australian indigenous boy, became the focus of a viral video in 2020. Quaden was born with achondroplasia, a form of dwarfism. 

The video, which gained global attention, was filmed by his mother, Yarraka Bayles, on February 19, 2020. It shows Quaden in a highly distressed state, crying uncontrollably in the back of a car after a day at school where he was bullied. 

The emotional intensity of the video is evident as Quaden expresses a desire to harm himself, saying, ‚ÄúI wish I could stab myself in the heart‚Äù and ‚ÄúGive me a knife, I want to k*ll myself‚Äù‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã.

"Long post warning üö® 

I think I‚Äôve figured out why I‚Äôm so turned off with the current left: they have become the establishment. 

Growing up the Republican Party, with its oppressive brand of moral conservatism, felt like the owners of the ‚Äúestablishment.‚Äù

The hippies and the left were a reaction to that. Free love, rock and roll, anti-war, anti-establishment.  That was followed by punk rock culture ‚Äî liberals continued to be the standard bearers of the antiestablishment. 

Even into the 90s/2000s, you had anti-war liberals pushing back against the Falwell moral majority and protesting the Iraq war (that was me üëã).  Then the pushback to the disastrous neocon political movement of the post-9/11 2000s. 

Then it all started to change. Trump in 2016 flipped everything on its head. Suddenly republicans were much less hawkish, ignoring foreign wars. and the liberals lost their mind with TDS. So everything then became a reaction to trump. 

Then covid hit and things really got weird. 

Liberals started pushing for even greater state control. Forced closures of businesses, executive orders, vaccine mandates, clamping down on constitutional rights. 

And they also started cheering US military action abroad in the Ukraine. Obama started this with his love for drone warfare. Now we see the left cheering the political prosecution of their political opponents. Grim. 

So now, all the sudden, the anti-establishment left of the last 60 years has swung hard to become the people they‚Äôve fought against. 

And there‚Äôs nothing less punk rock than fighting for the establishment.",31,376,bullying detected

"10. Club Friday Season 16: Love Bully (2024)

Episodes: 4
Airs: Jun 7, 2024 - Jun 28, 2024
Airs On: Friday
Original Network: One 31

Main Cast: Charlotte Austin , Engfa Waraha

Plot
In the era of social media, everyone can freely express their opinions about others. They can use harsh words without much consideration, not thinking about the consequences or verifying the truth.

In a relationship between two women, one becomes overly concerned with the opinions of others, making her vulnerable to someone she doesn't know who ends up hurting her. The second woman has never cared much, firmly believing in the adage ""to each their own."" However, at times, she can be remarkably oblivious to the feelings of those around her.

With their love in the spotlight, eyes across the nation scrutinise their every move, passing judgement on ever action.

"Theres this false narrative going around that I ‚Äúdefended Nick‚Äù & am therefore ‚Äúpro child neglect/abuse including drugs & swinging‚Äù. This false narrative has been repeated in my mentions for days all because I‚Äôm guilty of not immediately giving my opinion & condemning Nick. Every time I‚Äôve confronted someone accusing me of this I ask for them to provide me with one single receipt and they can‚Äôt because they don‚Äôt exist. You want to get mad because I‚Äôve been on stream with people who have opinions you do or don‚Äôt like & I didn‚Äôt say anything? Well newsflash I rarely chime in to topics I have zero desire to discuss. Just because others have opinions doesn‚Äôt mean I agree with them simply because I‚Äôm in their presence. I think water tastes disgusting; I‚Äôm in fully aware that 99.9% of the population disagrees & that‚Äôs fine. Just because you‚Äôre in my presence doesn‚Äôt mean you automatically share my views(crazy how that works right).

Now another accusation is that I‚Äôm ‚Äúdefending Nick‚Äù because I called out Aaron.  Idk if it‚Äôs willing ignorance or you‚Äôre just not intelligent enough to understand that just because you‚Äôve deemed one person the ultimate villain does not disqualify other monsters in the situation. Before all this started I didn‚Äôt know who tf this guy was. What I saw was a total sleezeball capitalizing on a situation for personal gain at the expense of children. My entire timeline was full of this jackass stirring the pot with disgusting sex stories that had nothing to actually do with the case but were just his ‚Äúinside scoop‚Äù for his 15minutes of fame. It absolutely disgusted me that someone could say the things he did stream after stream with a gigantic smile on his face. He knew those kids & claimed to care but was just a POS that didn‚Äôt do anything & yet still instead of helping them only continued to make their lives worse. They‚Äôre from a small town & this is a huge scandal. They‚Äôre already being judged by everyone around them & anyone including them can look up their last name & find any of the streams/clips of that jackass talking shit about their parents. Now if you still don‚Äôt understand why I would choose to call that shit out idk what to tell you this is something even Forest Gump would understand. 

Lastly all this situation has done has open my eyes to the amount of cancel culture pigs on my timeline. Every single one of you that accused me shit because I kept my opinions to myself are no better than the wackos that went after Gina or anyone else that steps out of line & doesn‚Äôt conform to your ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù. I‚Äôve seen your tweets & know who you are. All of you with the ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not with me then you‚Äôre my enemy‚Äù narrative should really take a step back and think about what you‚Äôre doing because It‚Äôs not good. Maybe take a minute & apply some common sense before demonizing me of ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù I didn‚Äôt commit or making accusations against me because I didn‚Äôt ‚Äústep in line‚Äù in the what you considered is a timely manner. Canceling me over your imaginary opinions won‚Äôt end well & forcing me to bend the knee to your will is only going to end in disappointment for you. I don‚Äôt put up with that kind of bs & I never will. 

At the end of the day my opinion on this really doesn‚Äôt matter nor will it change a single thing. Those kids have seen enough & me adding to it ultimately will not help. Everyone that actually knows me knows where I stand on this including Nick. Going after me with pitchforks because you want blood isn‚Äôt going to solve anything.

"I received some hateful comments on my post about Biden. Apparently, I was cruel when I made remarks about his speech and said it made no sense. They say it's ""bullying"" - to write a post about most powerful man in the world, who is trying to save Hamas, so that they'd continue m*rdering, r*ping and kidnapping Israelis.

Isn't it displaced suicidal ""empathy"" that @GadSaad is always talking about?

Powerful white rich man is trying to save horrific monsters from hell, because of his own selfish interests, but I am supposed to be sensitive to his special needs? 

Hamas said that October 7 was great success and they want to continue doing it. To m*rder innocent Israelis, including babies, children, to burn people alive, to ashes, so that it took weeks to identify. To r*pe women while slicing their breasts off and play football with body parts. But sure, the most important is to be kind to a person who wants all this to continue.

Speaking of people with disabilities, many of them were m*rdered, sla*ghtered, r*ped and kidnapped by Hamas.

Ruth Perez with her father Eric were brutally m*rdered by Hamas at music festival. Ruth couldn't walk or talk but music was her life. What kind of monsters don't have mercy for such an innocent disabled girl?

Kapshiter family - parents Dina and Evgeny, and children Alin and Ethan were brutally m*rdered by Hamas monsters, when trying to escape. Hamas savages saw that it is a family with kids in the car, why did they sla*ghter them?? Ethan was a kid with special needs. Alin's body was found in another location weeks after her parents and brother's bodies were found. What did the horrific monsters do to her before m*rdering?

Noya Dan, 13 years old, was autistic girl. Hamas savages dragged her and her grandmother to Gaza border, m*rdered them and dumped their bodies in the dirt.

I have many more examples.
I am thinking about all of them every day.
I can't stop writing about them.
I can't sleep at night.

And white rich supremacist Biden doesn't care. He wants Hamas to win, to recover, to continue. Me, my family, my friends, kids I work with - we all will be the next victims. 

I was quiet about Biden for 8 months, hoping that maybe he cares, a bit. But no. He doesn't.

"Long post warning üö® 

I think I‚Äôve figured out why I‚Äôm so turned off with the current left: they have become the establishment. 

Growing up the Republican Party, with its oppressive brand of moral conservatism, felt like the owners of the ‚Äúestablishment.‚Äù

The hippies and the left were a reaction to that. Free love, rock and roll, anti-war, anti-establishment.  That was followed by punk rock culture ‚Äî liberals continued to be the standard bearers of the antiestablishment. 

Even into the 90s/2000s, you had anti-war liberals pushing back against the Falwell moral majority and protesting the Iraq war (that was me üëã).  Then the pushback to the disastrous neocon political movement of the post-9/11 2000s. 

Then it all started to change. Trump in 2016 flipped everything on its head. Suddenly republicans were much less hawkish, ignoring foreign wars. and the liberals lost their mind with TDS. So everything then became a reaction to trump. 

Then covid hit and things really got weird. 

Liberals started pushing for even greater state control. Forced closures of businesses, executive orders, vaccine mandates, clamping down on constitutional rights. 

And they also started cheering US military action abroad in the Ukraine. Obama started this with his love for drone warfare. Now we see the left cheering the political prosecution of their political opponents. Grim. 

So now, all the sudden, the anti-establishment left of the last 60 years has swung hard to become the people they‚Äôve fought against.

Episodes: 4
Airs: Jun 7, 2024 - Jun 28, 2024
Airs On: Friday
Original Network: One 31

Main Cast: Charlotte Austin , Engfa Waraha

Plot
In the era of social media, everyone can freely express their opinions about others. They can use harsh words without much consideration, not thinking about the consequences or verifying the truth.

In a relationship between two women, one becomes overly concerned with the opinions of others, making her vulnerable to someone she doesn't know who ends up hurting her. The second woman has never cared much, firmly believing in the adage ""to each their own."" However, at times, she can be remarkably oblivious to the feelings of those around her.

With their love in the spotlight, eyes across the nation scrutinise their every move, passing judgement on ever action.

"Theres this false narrative going around that I ‚Äúdefended Nick‚Äù & am therefore ‚Äúpro child neglect/abuse including drugs & swinging‚Äù. This false narrative has been repeated in my mentions for days all because I‚Äôm guilty of not immediately giving my opinion & condemning Nick. Every time I‚Äôve confronted someone accusing me of this I ask for them to provide me with one single receipt and they can‚Äôt because they don‚Äôt exist. You want to get mad because I‚Äôve been on stream with people who have opinions you do or don‚Äôt like & I didn‚Äôt say anything? Well newsflash I rarely chime in to topics I have zero desire to discuss. Just because others have opinions doesn‚Äôt mean I agree with them simply because I‚Äôm in their presence. I think water tastes disgusting; I‚Äôm in fully aware that 99.9% of the population disagrees & that‚Äôs fine. Just because you‚Äôre in my presence doesn‚Äôt mean you automatically share my views(crazy how that works right).

Now another accusation is that I‚Äôm ‚Äúdefending Nick‚Äù because I called out Aaron.  Idk if it‚Äôs willing ignorance or you‚Äôre just not intelligent enough to understand that just because you‚Äôve deemed one person the ultimate villain does not disqualify other monsters in the situation. Before all this started I didn‚Äôt know who tf this guy was. What I saw was a total sleezeball capitalizing on a situation for personal gain at the expense of children. My entire timeline was full of this jackass stirring the pot with disgusting sex stories that had nothing to actually do with the case but were just his ‚Äúinside scoop‚Äù for his 15minutes of fame. It absolutely disgusted me that someone could say the things he did stream after stream with a gigantic smile on his face. He knew those kids & claimed to care but was just a POS that didn‚Äôt do anything & yet still instead of helping them only continued to make their lives worse. They‚Äôre from a small town & this is a huge scandal. They‚Äôre already being judged by everyone around them & anyone including them can look up their last name & find any of the streams/clips of that jackass talking shit about their parents. Now if you still don‚Äôt understand why I would choose to call that shit out idk what to tell you this is something even Forest Gump would understand. 

Lastly all this situation has done has open my eyes to the amount of cancel culture pigs on my timeline. Every single one of you that accused me shit because I kept my opinions to myself are no better than the wackos that went after Gina or anyone else that steps out of line & doesn‚Äôt conform to your ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù. I‚Äôve seen your tweets & know who you are. All of you with the ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not with me then you‚Äôre my enemy‚Äù narrative should really take a step back and think about what you‚Äôre doing because It‚Äôs not good. Maybe take a minute & apply some common sense before demonizing me of ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù I didn‚Äôt commit or making accusations against me because I didn‚Äôt ‚Äústep in line‚Äù in the what you considered is a timely manner. Canceling me over your imaginary opinions won‚Äôt end well & forcing me to bend the knee to your will is only going to end in disappointment for you. I don‚Äôt put up with that kind of bs & I never will. 

At the end of the day my opinion on this really doesn‚Äôt matter nor will it change a single thing. Those kids have seen enough & me adding to it ultimately will not help. Everyone that actually knows me knows where I stand on this including Nick. Going after me with pitchforks because you want blood isn‚Äôt going to solve anything.

More context:
Quaden Bayles, an Australian indigenous boy, became the focus of a viral video in 2020. Quaden was born with achondroplasia, a form of dwarfism. 

The video, which gained global attention, was filmed by his mother, Yarraka Bayles, on February 19, 2020. It shows Quaden in a highly distressed state, crying uncontrollably in the back of a car after a day at school where he was bullied.

Isn't it displaced suicidal ""empathy"" that @GadSaad is always talking about?

Powerful white rich man is trying to save horrific monsters from hell, because of his own selfish interests, but I am supposed to be sensitive to his special needs? 

Hamas said that October 7 was great success and they want to continue doing it. To m*rder innocent Israelis, including babies, children, to burn people alive, to ashes, so that it took weeks to identify. To r*pe women while slicing their breasts off and play football with body parts. But sure, the most important is to be kind to a person who wants all this to continue.

Speaking of people with disabilities, many of them were m*rdered, sla*ghtered, r*ped and kidnapped by Hamas.

Ruth Perez with her father Eric were brutally m*rdered by Hamas at music festival. Ruth couldn't walk or talk but music was her life. What kind of monsters don't have mercy for such an innocent disabled girl?

Kapshiter family - parents Dina and Evgeny, and children Alin and Ethan were brutally m*rdered by Hamas monsters, when trying to escape. Hamas savages saw that it is a family with kids in the car, why did they sla*ghter them?? Ethan was a kid with special needs. Alin's body was found in another location weeks after her parents and brother's bodies were found. What did the horrific monsters do to her before m*rdering?

Noya Dan, 13 years old, was autistic girl. Hamas savages dragged her and her grandmother to Gaza border, m*rdered them and dumped their bodies in the dirt.

I have many more examples.
I am thinking about all of them every day.
I can't stop writing about them.
I can't sleep at night.

And white rich supremacist Biden doesn't care. He wants Hamas to win, to recover, to continue. Me, my family, my friends, kids I work with - we all will be the next victims.

"Long post warning üö® 

I think I‚Äôve figured out why I‚Äôm so turned off with the current left: they have become the establishment. 

Growing up the Republican Party, with its oppressive brand of moral conservatism, felt like the owners of the ‚Äúestablishment.‚Äù

The hippies and the left were a reaction to that. Free love, rock and roll, anti-war, anti-establishment.  That was followed by punk rock culture ‚Äî liberals continued to be the standard bearers of the antiestablishment. 

Even into the 90s/2000s, you had anti-war liberals pushing back against the Falwell moral majority and protesting the Iraq war (that was me üëã).  Then the pushback to the disastrous neocon political movement of the post-9/11 2000s. 

Then it all started to change. Trump in 2016 flipped everything on its head. Suddenly republicans were much less hawkish, ignoring foreign wars. and the liberals lost their mind with TDS. So everything then became a reaction to trump. 

Then covid hit and things really got weird. 

Liberals started pushing for even greater state control. Forced closures of businesses, executive orders, vaccine mandates, clamping down on constitutional rights. 

And they also started cheering US military action abroad in the Ukraine. Obama started this with his love for drone warfare. Now we see the left cheering the political prosecution of their political opponents. Grim. 

So now, all the sudden, the anti-establishment left of the last 60 years has swung hard to become the people they‚Äôve fought against.

Episodes: 4
Airs: Jun 7, 2024 - Jun 28, 2024
Airs On: Friday
Original Network: One 31

Main Cast: Charlotte Austin , Engfa Waraha

Plot
In the era of social media, everyone can freely express their opinions about others. They can use harsh words without much consideration, not thinking about the consequences or verifying the truth.

In a relationship between two women, one becomes overly concerned with the opinions of others, making her vulnerable to someone she doesn't know who ends up hurting her. The second woman has never cared much, firmly believing in the adage ""to each their own."" However, at times, she can be remarkably oblivious to the feelings of those around her.

With their love in the spotlight, eyes across the nation scrutinise their every move, passing judgement on ever action.

It absolutely disgusted me that someone could say the things he did stream after stream with a gigantic smile on his face. He knew those kids & claimed to care but was just a POS that didn‚Äôt do anything & yet still instead of helping them only continued to make their lives worse. They‚Äôre from a small town & this is a huge scandal. They‚Äôre already being judged by everyone around them & anyone including them can look up their last name & find any of the streams/clips of that jackass talking shit about their parents. Now if you still don‚Äôt understand why I would choose to call that shit out idk what to tell you this is something even Forest Gump would understand. 

Lastly all this situation has done has open my eyes to the amount of cancel culture pigs on my timeline. Every single one of you that accused me shit because I kept my opinions to myself are no better than the wackos that went after Gina or anyone else that steps out of line & doesn‚Äôt conform to your ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù. I‚Äôve seen your tweets & know who you are. All of you with the ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not with me then you‚Äôre my enemy‚Äù narrative should really take a step back and think about what you‚Äôre doing because It‚Äôs not good. Maybe take a minute & apply some common sense before demonizing me of ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù I didn‚Äôt commit or making accusations against me because I didn‚Äôt ‚Äústep in line‚Äù in the what you considered is a timely manner. Canceling me over your imaginary opinions won‚Äôt end well & forcing me to bend the knee to your will is only going to end in disappointment for you. I don‚Äôt put up with that kind of bs & I never will. 

At the end of the day my opinion on this really doesn‚Äôt matter nor will it change a single thing. Those kids have seen enough & me adding to it ultimately will not help. Everyone that actually knows me knows where I stand on this including Nick. Going after me with pitchforks because you want blood isn‚Äôt going to solve anything. It just exposes you cancel pigs for who you truly are.",41,698,bullying detected

The video, which gained global attention, was filmed by his mother, Yarraka Bayles, on February 19, 2020. It shows Quaden in a highly distressed state, crying uncontrollably in the back of a car after a day at school where he was bullied.

"Long post warning üö® 

I think I‚Äôve figured out why I‚Äôm so turned off with the current left: they have become the establishment. 

Growing up the Republican Party, with its oppressive brand of moral conservatism, felt like the owners of the ‚Äúestablishment.‚Äù

The hippies and the left were a reaction to that. Free love, rock and roll, anti-war, anti-establishment.  That was followed by punk rock culture ‚Äî liberals continued to be the standard bearers of the antiestablishment. 

Even into the 90s/2000s, you had anti-war liberals pushing back against the Falwell moral majority and protesting the Iraq war (that was me üëã).  Then the pushback to the disastrous neocon political movement of the post-9/11 2000s. 

Then it all started to change. Trump in 2016 flipped everything on its head. Suddenly republicans were much less hawkish, ignoring foreign wars. and the liberals lost their mind with TDS. So everything then became a reaction to trump. 

Then covid hit and things really got weird. 

Liberals started pushing for even greater state control. Forced closures of businesses, executive orders, vaccine mandates, clamping down on constitutional rights. 

And they also started cheering US military action abroad in the Ukraine. Obama started this with his love for drone warfare. Now we see the left cheering the political prosecution of their political opponents. Grim. 

So now, all the sudden, the anti-establishment left of the last 60 years has swung hard to become the people they‚Äôve fought against. 

And there‚Äôs nothing less punk rock than fighting for the establishment.",32,378,bullying detected

"10. Club Friday Season 16: Love Bully (2024)

Episodes: 4
Airs: Jun 7, 2024 - Jun 28, 2024
Airs On: Friday
Original Network: One 31

Main Cast: Charlotte Austin , Engfa Waraha

Plot
In the era of social media, everyone can freely express their opinions about others. They can use harsh words without much consideration, not thinking about the consequences or verifying the truth.

In a relationship between two women, one becomes overly concerned with the opinions of others, making her vulnerable to someone she doesn't know who ends up hurting her. The second woman has never cared much, firmly believing in the adage ""to each their own."" However, at times, she can be remarkably oblivious to the feelings of those around her.

With their love in the spotlight, eyes across the nation scrutinise their every move, passing judgement on ever action.

"Theres this false narrative going around that I ‚Äúdefended Nick‚Äù & am therefore ‚Äúpro child neglect/abuse including drugs & swinging‚Äù. This false narrative has been repeated in my mentions for days all because I‚Äôm guilty of not immediately giving my opinion & condemning Nick. Every time I‚Äôve confronted someone accusing me of this I ask for them to provide me with one single receipt and they can‚Äôt because they don‚Äôt exist. You want to get mad because I‚Äôve been on stream with people who have opinions you do or don‚Äôt like & I didn‚Äôt say anything? Well newsflash I rarely chime in to topics I have zero desire to discuss. Just because others have opinions doesn‚Äôt mean I agree with them simply because I‚Äôm in their presence. I think water tastes disgusting; I‚Äôm in fully aware that 99.9% of the population disagrees & that‚Äôs fine. Just because you‚Äôre in my presence doesn‚Äôt mean you automatically share my views(crazy how that works right).

Now another accusation is that I‚Äôm ‚Äúdefending Nick‚Äù because I called out Aaron.  Idk if it‚Äôs willing ignorance or you‚Äôre just not intelligent enough to understand that just because you‚Äôve deemed one person the ultimate villain does not disqualify other monsters in the situation. Before all this started I didn‚Äôt know who tf this guy was. What I saw was a total sleezeball capitalizing on a situation for personal gain at the expense of children. My entire timeline was full of this jackass stirring the pot with disgusting sex stories that had nothing to actually do with the case but were just his ‚Äúinside scoop‚Äù for his 15minutes of fame. It absolutely disgusted me that someone could say the things he did stream after stream with a gigantic smile on his face. He knew those kids & claimed to care but was just a POS that didn‚Äôt do anything & yet still instead of helping them only continued to make their lives worse. They‚Äôre from a small town & this is a huge scandal. They‚Äôre already being judged by everyone around them & anyone including them can look up their last name & find any of the streams/clips of that jackass talking shit about their parents. Now if you still don‚Äôt understand why I would choose to call that shit out idk what to tell you this is something even Forest Gump would understand. 

Lastly all this situation has done has open my eyes to the amount of cancel culture pigs on my timeline. Every single one of you that accused me shit because I kept my opinions to myself are no better than the wackos that went after Gina or anyone else that steps out of line & doesn‚Äôt conform to your ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù. I‚Äôve seen your tweets & know who you are. All of you with the ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not with me then you‚Äôre my enemy‚Äù narrative should really take a step back and think about what you‚Äôre doing because It‚Äôs not good. Maybe take a minute & apply some common sense before demonizing me of ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù I didn‚Äôt commit or making accusations against me because I didn‚Äôt ‚Äústep in line‚Äù in the what you considered is a timely manner. Canceling me over your imaginary opinions won‚Äôt end well & forcing me to bend the knee to your will is only going to end in disappointment for you. I don‚Äôt put up with that kind of bs & I never will. 

At the end of the day my opinion on this really doesn‚Äôt matter nor will it change a single thing. Those kids have seen enough & me adding to it ultimately will not help. Everyone that actually knows me knows where I stand on this including Nick. Going after me with pitchforks because you want blood isn‚Äôt going to solve anything.

"In 1998, Bill Clinton paid Paula Jones $850,000 to settle a s¬£xual harassment lawsuit. Despite the payment, Clinton faced no criminal charges. 

Fast forward to 2023, Donald Trump faced 34 felony counts in New York City for allegedly paying Stormy Daniels hush money during his 2016 campaign and was convicted yesterday with a guilty verdict. This stark difference in treatment raises questions about fairness in our legal system.

Why did Clinton escape felony charges while Trump is hit with 34? Is this about justice, or is there a double standard at play? It‚Äôs crucial to scrutinize how our legal system treats different figures under similar circumstances.",187,382,bullying detected

"I received some hateful comments on my post about Biden. Apparently, I was cruel when I made remarks about his speech and said it made no sense. They say it's ""bullying"" - to write a post about most powerful man in the world, who is trying to save Hamas, so that they'd continue m*rdering, r*ping and kidnapping Israelis.

Isn't it displaced suicidal ""empathy"" that @GadSaad is always talking about?

Powerful white rich man is trying to save horrific monsters from hell, because of his own selfish interests, but I am supposed to be sensitive to his special needs? 

Hamas said that October 7 was great success and they want to continue doing it. To m*rder innocent Israelis, including babies, children, to burn people alive, to ashes, so that it took weeks to identify. To r*pe women while slicing their breasts off and play football with body parts. But sure, the most important is to be kind to a person who wants all this to continue.

Speaking of people with disabilities, many of them were m*rdered, sla*ghtered, r*ped and kidnapped by Hamas.

Ruth Perez with her father Eric were brutally m*rdered by Hamas at music festival. Ruth couldn't walk or talk but music was her life. What kind of monsters don't have mercy for such an innocent disabled girl?

Kapshiter family - parents Dina and Evgeny, and children Alin and Ethan were brutally m*rdered by Hamas monsters, when trying to escape. Hamas savages saw that it is a family with kids in the car, why did they sla*ghter them?? Ethan was a kid with special needs. Alin's body was found in another location weeks after her parents and brother's bodies were found. What did the horrific monsters do to her before m*rdering?

Noya Dan, 13 years old, was autistic girl. Hamas savages dragged her and her grandmother to Gaza border, m*rdered them and dumped their bodies in the dirt.

I have many more examples.
I am thinking about all of them every day.
I can't stop writing about them.
I can't sleep at night.

And white rich supremacist Biden doesn't care. He wants Hamas to win, to recover, to continue. Me, my family, my friends, kids I work with - we all will be the next victims. 

I was quiet about Biden for 8 months, hoping that maybe he cares, a bit. But no. He doesn't.

More context:
Quaden Bayles, an Australian indigenous boy, became the focus of a viral video in 2020. Quaden was born with achondroplasia, a form of dwarfism. 

The video, which gained global attention, was filmed by his mother, Yarraka Bayles, on February 19, 2020. It shows Quaden in a highly distressed state, crying uncontrollably in the back of a car after a day at school where he was bullied. 

The emotional intensity of the video is evident as Quaden expresses a desire to harm himself, saying, ‚ÄúI wish I could stab myself in the heart‚Äù and ‚ÄúGive me a knife, I want to k*ll myself‚Äù‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã.

Every single one of you that accused me shit because I kept my opinions to myself are no better than the wackos that went after Gina or anyone else that steps out of line & doesn‚Äôt conform to your ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù. I‚Äôve seen your tweets & know who you are. All of you with the ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not with me then you‚Äôre my enemy‚Äù narrative should really take a step back and think about what you‚Äôre doing because It‚Äôs not good. Maybe take a minute & apply some common sense before demonizing me of ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù I didn‚Äôt commit or making accusations against me because I didn‚Äôt ‚Äústep in line‚Äù in the what you considered is a timely manner. Canceling me over your imaginary opinions won‚Äôt end well & forcing me to bend the knee to your will is only going to end in disappointment for you. I don‚Äôt put up with that kind of bs & I never will. 

At the end of the day my opinion on this really doesn‚Äôt matter nor will it change a single thing. Those kids have seen enough & me adding to it ultimately will not help. Everyone that actually knows me knows where I stand on this including Nick. Going after me with pitchforks because you want blood isn‚Äôt going to solve anything. It just exposes you cancel pigs for who you truly are.",42,704,bullying detected

"Long post warning üö® 

I think I‚Äôve figured out why I‚Äôm so turned off with the current left: they have become the establishment. 

Growing up the Republican Party, with its oppressive brand of moral conservatism, felt like the owners of the ‚Äúestablishment.‚Äù

The hippies and the left were a reaction to that. Free love, rock and roll, anti-war, anti-establishment.  That was followed by punk rock culture ‚Äî liberals continued to be the standard bearers of the antiestablishment. 

Even into the 90s/2000s, you had anti-war liberals pushing back against the Falwell moral majority and protesting the Iraq war (that was me üëã).  Then the pushback to the disastrous neocon political movement of the post-9/11 2000s. 

Then it all started to change. Trump in 2016 flipped everything on its head. Suddenly republicans were much less hawkish, ignoring foreign wars. and the liberals lost their mind with TDS. So everything then became a reaction to trump. 

Then covid hit and things really got weird. 

Liberals started pushing for even greater state control. Forced closures of businesses, executive orders, vaccine mandates, clamping down on constitutional rights. 

And they also started cheering US military action abroad in the Ukraine. Obama started this with his love for drone warfare. Now we see the left cheering the political prosecution of their political opponents. Grim. 

So now, all the sudden, the anti-establishment left of the last 60 years has swung hard to become the people they‚Äôve fought against.

Episodes: 4
Airs: Jun 7, 2024 - Jun 28, 2024
Airs On: Friday
Original Network: One 31

Main Cast: Charlotte Austin , Engfa Waraha

Plot
In the era of social media, everyone can freely express their opinions about others. They can use harsh words without much consideration, not thinking about the consequences or verifying the truth.

In a relationship between two women, one becomes overly concerned with the opinions of others, making her vulnerable to someone she doesn't know who ends up hurting her. The second woman has never cared much, firmly believing in the adage ""to each their own."" However, at times, she can be remarkably oblivious to the feelings of those around her.

With their love in the spotlight, eyes across the nation scrutinise their every move, passing judgement on ever action.

"I received some hateful comments on my post about Biden. Apparently, I was cruel when I made remarks about his speech and said it made no sense. They say it's ""bullying"" - to write a post about most powerful man in the world, who is trying to save Hamas, so that they'd continue m*rdering, r*ping and kidnapping Israelis.

Isn't it displaced suicidal ""empathy"" that @GadSaad is always talking about?

Powerful white rich man is trying to save horrific monsters from hell, because of his own selfish interests, but I am supposed to be sensitive to his special needs? 

Hamas said that October 7 was great success and they want to continue doing it. To m*rder innocent Israelis, including babies, children, to burn people alive, to ashes, so that it took weeks to identify. To r*pe women while slicing their breasts off and play football with body parts. But sure, the most important is to be kind to a person who wants all this to continue.

Speaking of people with disabilities, many of them were m*rdered, sla*ghtered, r*ped and kidnapped by Hamas.

Ruth Perez with her father Eric were brutally m*rdered by Hamas at music festival. Ruth couldn't walk or talk but music was her life. What kind of monsters don't have mercy for such an innocent disabled girl?

Kapshiter family - parents Dina and Evgeny, and children Alin and Ethan were brutally m*rdered by Hamas monsters, when trying to escape. Hamas savages saw that it is a family with kids in the car, why did they sla*ghter them?? Ethan was a kid with special needs. Alin's body was found in another location weeks after her parents and brother's bodies were found. What did the horrific monsters do to her before m*rdering?

Noya Dan, 13 years old, was autistic girl. Hamas savages dragged her and her grandmother to Gaza border, m*rdered them and dumped their bodies in the dirt.

I have many more examples.
I am thinking about all of them every day.
I can't stop writing about them.
I can't sleep at night.

And white rich supremacist Biden doesn't care. He wants Hamas to win, to recover, to continue. Me, my family, my friends, kids I work with - we all will be the next victims.

The abuser will try to control and isolates you, cutting you off from support and making you feel dependent and powerless. They may alternate between being nice and cruel, leaving you in a constant state of anxiety, desperately seeking their approval. The victim may look like they are lying or crazy when they try to explain what‚Äôs going on because the narcissist‚Äôs two-faced nature is shamelessly hidden behind a mask of charm, lies, manipulation and smear campaigns. This kind of abuse can lead to serious emotional damage, including anxiety, depression, a loss of self-worth, and in extreme cases, C-PTSD, self medication, or suicide. It could be described as covert psychological violence.",288,631,no bullying

"Theres this false narrative going around that I ‚Äúdefended Nick‚Äù & am therefore ‚Äúpro child neglect/abuse including drugs & swinging‚Äù. This false narrative has been repeated in my mentions for days all because I‚Äôm guilty of not immediately giving my opinion & condemning Nick. Every time I‚Äôve confronted someone accusing me of this I ask for them to provide me with one single receipt and they can‚Äôt because they don‚Äôt exist. You want to get mad because I‚Äôve been on stream with people who have opinions you do or don‚Äôt like & I didn‚Äôt say anything? Well newsflash I rarely chime in to topics I have zero desire to discuss. Just because others have opinions doesn‚Äôt mean I agree with them simply because I‚Äôm in their presence. I think water tastes disgusting; I‚Äôm in fully aware that 99.9% of the population disagrees & that‚Äôs fine. Just because you‚Äôre in my presence doesn‚Äôt mean you automatically share my views(crazy how that works right).

Now another accusation is that I‚Äôm ‚Äúdefending Nick‚Äù because I called out Aaron.  Idk if it‚Äôs willing ignorance or you‚Äôre just not intelligent enough to understand that just because you‚Äôve deemed one person the ultimate villain does not disqualify other monsters in the situation. Before all this started I didn‚Äôt know who tf this guy was. What I saw was a total sleezeball capitalizing on a situation for personal gain at the expense of children. My entire timeline was full of this jackass stirring the pot with disgusting sex stories that had nothing to actually do with the case but were just his ‚Äúinside scoop‚Äù for his 15minutes of fame. It absolutely disgusted me that someone could say the things he did stream after stream with a gigantic smile on his face. He knew those kids & claimed to care but was just a POS that didn‚Äôt do anything & yet still instead of helping them only continued to make their lives worse. They‚Äôre from a small town & this is a huge scandal. They‚Äôre already being judged by everyone around them & anyone including them can look up their last name & find any of the streams/clips of that jackass talking shit about their parents. Now if you still don‚Äôt understand why I would choose to call that shit out idk what to tell you this is something even Forest Gump would understand. 

Lastly all this situation has done has open my eyes to the amount of cancel culture pigs on my timeline. Every single one of you that accused me shit because I kept my opinions to myself are no better than the wackos that went after Gina or anyone else that steps out of line & doesn‚Äôt conform to your ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù. I‚Äôve seen your tweets & know who you are. All of you with the ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not with me then you‚Äôre my enemy‚Äù narrative should really take a step back and think about what you‚Äôre doing because It‚Äôs not good. Maybe take a minute & apply some common sense before demonizing me of ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù I didn‚Äôt commit or making accusations against me because I didn‚Äôt ‚Äústep in line‚Äù in the what you considered is a timely manner. Canceling me over your imaginary opinions won‚Äôt end well & forcing me to bend the knee to your will is only going to end in disappointment for you. I don‚Äôt put up with that kind of bs & I never will. 

At the end of the day my opinion on this really doesn‚Äôt matter nor will it change a single thing. Those kids have seen enough & me adding to it ultimately will not help. Everyone that actually knows me knows where I stand on this including Nick. Going after me with pitchforks because you want blood isn‚Äôt going to solve anything.

"Long post warning üö® 

I think I‚Äôve figured out why I‚Äôm so turned off with the current left: they have become the establishment. 

Growing up the Republican Party, with its oppressive brand of moral conservatism, felt like the owners of the ‚Äúestablishment.‚Äù

The hippies and the left were a reaction to that. Free love, rock and roll, anti-war, anti-establishment.  That was followed by punk rock culture ‚Äî liberals continued to be the standard bearers of the antiestablishment. 

Even into the 90s/2000s, you had anti-war liberals pushing back against the Falwell moral majority and protesting the Iraq war (that was me üëã).  Then the pushback to the disastrous neocon political movement of the post-9/11 2000s. 

Then it all started to change. Trump in 2016 flipped everything on its head. Suddenly republicans were much less hawkish, ignoring foreign wars. and the liberals lost their mind with TDS. So everything then became a reaction to trump. 

Then covid hit and things really got weird. 

Liberals started pushing for even greater state control. Forced closures of businesses, executive orders, vaccine mandates, clamping down on constitutional rights. 

And they also started cheering US military action abroad in the Ukraine. Obama started this with his love for drone warfare. Now we see the left cheering the political prosecution of their political opponents. Grim. 

So now, all the sudden, the anti-establishment left of the last 60 years has swung hard to become the people they‚Äôve fought against. 

And there‚Äôs nothing less punk rock than fighting for the establishment.",32,379,bullying detected

Episodes: 4
Airs: Jun 7, 2024 - Jun 28, 2024
Airs On: Friday
Original Network: One 31

Main Cast: Charlotte Austin , Engfa Waraha

Plot
In the era of social media, everyone can freely express their opinions about others. They can use harsh words without much consideration, not thinking about the consequences or verifying the truth.

In a relationship between two women, one becomes overly concerned with the opinions of others, making her vulnerable to someone she doesn't know who ends up hurting her. The second woman has never cared much, firmly believing in the adage ""to each their own."" However, at times, she can be remarkably oblivious to the feelings of those around her.

With their love in the spotlight, eyes across the nation scrutinise their every move, passing judgement on ever action.

"I received some hateful comments on my post about Biden. Apparently, I was cruel when I made remarks about his speech and said it made no sense. They say it's ""bullying"" - to write a post about most powerful man in the world, who is trying to save Hamas, so that they'd continue m*rdering, r*ping and kidnapping Israelis.

Isn't it displaced suicidal ""empathy"" that @GadSaad is always talking about?

Powerful white rich man is trying to save horrific monsters from hell, because of his own selfish interests, but I am supposed to be sensitive to his special needs? 

Hamas said that October 7 was great success and they want to continue doing it. To m*rder innocent Israelis, including babies, children, to burn people alive, to ashes, so that it took weeks to identify. To r*pe women while slicing their breasts off and play football with body parts. But sure, the most important is to be kind to a person who wants all this to continue.

Speaking of people with disabilities, many of them were m*rdered, sla*ghtered, r*ped and kidnapped by Hamas.

Ruth Perez with her father Eric were brutally m*rdered by Hamas at music festival. Ruth couldn't walk or talk but music was her life. What kind of monsters don't have mercy for such an innocent disabled girl?

Kapshiter family - parents Dina and Evgeny, and children Alin and Ethan were brutally m*rdered by Hamas monsters, when trying to escape. Hamas savages saw that it is a family with kids in the car, why did they sla*ghter them?? Ethan was a kid with special needs. Alin's body was found in another location weeks after her parents and brother's bodies were found. What did the horrific monsters do to her before m*rdering?

Noya Dan, 13 years old, was autistic girl. Hamas savages dragged her and her grandmother to Gaza border, m*rdered them and dumped their bodies in the dirt.

I have many more examples.
I am thinking about all of them every day.
I can't stop writing about them.
I can't sleep at night.

And white rich supremacist Biden doesn't care. He wants Hamas to win, to recover, to continue. Me, my family, my friends, kids I work with - we all will be the next victims.

Fast forward to 2023, Donald Trump faced 34 felony counts in New York City for allegedly paying Stormy Daniels hush money during his 2016 campaign and was convicted yesterday with a guilty verdict. This stark difference in treatment raises questions about fairness in our legal system.

Why did Clinton escape felony charges while Trump is hit with 34? Is this about justice, or is there a double standard at play? It‚Äôs crucial to scrutinize how our legal system treats different figures under similar circumstances.",187,381,bullying detected

"Theres this false narrative going around that I ‚Äúdefended Nick‚Äù & am therefore ‚Äúpro child neglect/abuse including drugs & swinging‚Äù. This false narrative has been repeated in my mentions for days all because I‚Äôm guilty of not immediately giving my opinion & condemning Nick. Every time I‚Äôve confronted someone accusing me of this I ask for them to provide me with one single receipt and they can‚Äôt because they don‚Äôt exist. You want to get mad because I‚Äôve been on stream with people who have opinions you do or don‚Äôt like & I didn‚Äôt say anything? Well newsflash I rarely chime in to topics I have zero desire to discuss. Just because others have opinions doesn‚Äôt mean I agree with them simply because I‚Äôm in their presence. I think water tastes disgusting; I‚Äôm in fully aware that 99.9% of the population disagrees & that‚Äôs fine. Just because you‚Äôre in my presence doesn‚Äôt mean you automatically share my views(crazy how that works right).

Now another accusation is that I‚Äôm ‚Äúdefending Nick‚Äù because I called out Aaron.  Idk if it‚Äôs willing ignorance or you‚Äôre just not intelligent enough to understand that just because you‚Äôve deemed one person the ultimate villain does not disqualify other monsters in the situation. Before all this started I didn‚Äôt know who tf this guy was. What I saw was a total sleezeball capitalizing on a situation for personal gain at the expense of children. My entire timeline was full of this jackass stirring the pot with disgusting sex stories that had nothing to actually do with the case but were just his ‚Äúinside scoop‚Äù for his 15minutes of fame. It absolutely disgusted me that someone could say the things he did stream after stream with a gigantic smile on his face. He knew those kids & claimed to care but was just a POS that didn‚Äôt do anything & yet still instead of helping them only continued to make their lives worse. They‚Äôre from a small town & this is a huge scandal. They‚Äôre already being judged by everyone around them & anyone including them can look up their last name & find any of the streams/clips of that jackass talking shit about their parents. Now if you still don‚Äôt understand why I would choose to call that shit out idk what to tell you this is something even Forest Gump would understand. 

Lastly all this situation has done has open my eyes to the amount of cancel culture pigs on my timeline. Every single one of you that accused me shit because I kept my opinions to myself are no better than the wackos that went after Gina or anyone else that steps out of line & doesn‚Äôt conform to your ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù. I‚Äôve seen your tweets & know who you are. All of you with the ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not with me then you‚Äôre my enemy‚Äù narrative should really take a step back and think about what you‚Äôre doing because It‚Äôs not good. Maybe take a minute & apply some common sense before demonizing me of ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù I didn‚Äôt commit or making accusations against me because I didn‚Äôt ‚Äústep in line‚Äù in the what you considered is a timely manner. Canceling me over your imaginary opinions won‚Äôt end well & forcing me to bend the knee to your will is only going to end in disappointment for you. I don‚Äôt put up with that kind of bs & I never will. 

At the end of the day my opinion on this really doesn‚Äôt matter nor will it change a single thing. Those kids have seen enough & me adding to it ultimately will not help. Everyone that actually knows me knows where I stand on this including Nick. Going after me with pitchforks because you want blood isn‚Äôt going to solve anything.

Then it all started to change. Trump in 2016 flipped everything on its head. Suddenly republicans were much less hawkish, ignoring foreign wars. and the liberals lost their mind with TDS. So everything then became a reaction to trump. 

Then covid hit and things really got weird. 

Liberals started pushing for even greater state control. Forced closures of businesses, executive orders, vaccine mandates, clamping down on constitutional rights. 

And they also started cheering US military action abroad in the Ukraine. Obama started this with his love for drone warfare. Now we see the left cheering the political prosecution of their political opponents. Grim. 

So now, all the sudden, the anti-establishment left of the last 60 years has swung hard to become the people they‚Äôve fought against. 

And there‚Äôs nothing less punk rock than fighting for the establishment.",32,379,bullying detected

"10. Club Friday Season 16: Love Bully (2024)

Episodes: 4
Airs: Jun 7, 2024 - Jun 28, 2024
Airs On: Friday
Original Network: One 31

Main Cast: Charlotte Austin , Engfa Waraha

Plot
In the era of social media, everyone can freely express their opinions about others. They can use harsh words without much consideration, not thinking about the consequences or verifying the truth.

In a relationship between two women, one becomes overly concerned with the opinions of others, making her vulnerable to someone she doesn't know who ends up hurting her. The second woman has never cared much, firmly believing in the adage ""to each their own."" However, at times, she can be remarkably oblivious to the feelings of those around her.

With their love in the spotlight, eyes across the nation scrutinise their every move, passing judgement on ever action.

"Theres this false narrative going around that I ‚Äúdefended Nick‚Äù & am therefore ‚Äúpro child neglect/abuse including drugs & swinging‚Äù. This false narrative has been repeated in my mentions for days all because I‚Äôm guilty of not immediately giving my opinion & condemning Nick. Every time I‚Äôve confronted someone accusing me of this I ask for them to provide me with one single receipt and they can‚Äôt because they don‚Äôt exist. You want to get mad because I‚Äôve been on stream with people who have opinions you do or don‚Äôt like & I didn‚Äôt say anything? Well newsflash I rarely chime in to topics I have zero desire to discuss. Just because others have opinions doesn‚Äôt mean I agree with them simply because I‚Äôm in their presence. I think water tastes disgusting; I‚Äôm in fully aware that 99.9% of the population disagrees & that‚Äôs fine. Just because you‚Äôre in my presence doesn‚Äôt mean you automatically share my views(crazy how that works right).

Now another accusation is that I‚Äôm ‚Äúdefending Nick‚Äù because I called out Aaron.  Idk if it‚Äôs willing ignorance or you‚Äôre just not intelligent enough to understand that just because you‚Äôve deemed one person the ultimate villain does not disqualify other monsters in the situation. Before all this started I didn‚Äôt know who tf this guy was. What I saw was a total sleezeball capitalizing on a situation for personal gain at the expense of children. My entire timeline was full of this jackass stirring the pot with disgusting sex stories that had nothing to actually do with the case but were just his ‚Äúinside scoop‚Äù for his 15minutes of fame. It absolutely disgusted me that someone could say the things he did stream after stream with a gigantic smile on his face. He knew those kids & claimed to care but was just a POS that didn‚Äôt do anything & yet still instead of helping them only continued to make their lives worse. They‚Äôre from a small town & this is a huge scandal. They‚Äôre already being judged by everyone around them & anyone including them can look up their last name & find any of the streams/clips of that jackass talking shit about their parents. Now if you still don‚Äôt understand why I would choose to call that shit out idk what to tell you this is something even Forest Gump would understand. 

Lastly all this situation has done has open my eyes to the amount of cancel culture pigs on my timeline. Every single one of you that accused me shit because I kept my opinions to myself are no better than the wackos that went after Gina or anyone else that steps out of line & doesn‚Äôt conform to your ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù. I‚Äôve seen your tweets & know who you are. All of you with the ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not with me then you‚Äôre my enemy‚Äù narrative should really take a step back and think about what you‚Äôre doing because It‚Äôs not good. Maybe take a minute & apply some common sense before demonizing me of ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù I didn‚Äôt commit or making accusations against me because I didn‚Äôt ‚Äústep in line‚Äù in the what you considered is a timely manner. Canceling me over your imaginary opinions won‚Äôt end well & forcing me to bend the knee to your will is only going to end in disappointment for you. I don‚Äôt put up with that kind of bs & I never will. 

At the end of the day my opinion on this really doesn‚Äôt matter nor will it change a single thing. Those kids have seen enough & me adding to it ultimately will not help. Everyone that actually knows me knows where I stand on this including Nick. Going after me with pitchforks because you want blood isn‚Äôt going to solve anything. It just exposes you cancel pigs for who you truly are.",42,709,bullying detected

I think I‚Äôve figured out why I‚Äôm so turned off with the current left: they have become the establishment. 

Growing up the Republican Party, with its oppressive brand of moral conservatism, felt like the owners of the ‚Äúestablishment.‚Äù

The hippies and the left were a reaction to that. Free love, rock and roll, anti-war, anti-establishment.  That was followed by punk rock culture ‚Äî liberals continued to be the standard bearers of the antiestablishment. 

Even into the 90s/2000s, you had anti-war liberals pushing back against the Falwell moral majority and protesting the Iraq war (that was me üëã).  Then the pushback to the disastrous neocon political movement of the post-9/11 2000s. 

Then it all started to change. Trump in 2016 flipped everything on its head. Suddenly republicans were much less hawkish, ignoring foreign wars. and the liberals lost their mind with TDS. So everything then became a reaction to trump. 

Then covid hit and things really got weird. 

Liberals started pushing for even greater state control. Forced closures of businesses, executive orders, vaccine mandates, clamping down on constitutional rights. 

And they also started cheering US military action abroad in the Ukraine. Obama started this with his love for drone warfare. Now we see the left cheering the political prosecution of their political opponents. Grim. 

So now, all the sudden, the anti-establishment left of the last 60 years has swung hard to become the people they‚Äôve fought against.

Airs On: Friday
Original Network: One 31

Main Cast: Charlotte Austin , Engfa Waraha

Plot
In the era of social media, everyone can freely express their opinions about others. They can use harsh words without much consideration, not thinking about the consequences or verifying the truth.

In a relationship between two women, one becomes overly concerned with the opinions of others, making her vulnerable to someone she doesn't know who ends up hurting her. The second woman has never cared much, firmly believing in the adage ""to each their own."" However, at times, she can be remarkably oblivious to the feelings of those around her.

With their love in the spotlight, eyes across the nation scrutinise their every move, passing judgement on ever action.

Republican-controlled House could have -- but didn't -- effectively SHUT DOWN the Bragg and other lawless Biden regime/Democratic party sham prosecutions and harassment of Trump. Inexcusable failure of leadership.  And now another election is already compromised and the country is destabilized.

"In 1998, Bill Clinton paid Paula Jones $850,000 to settle a s¬£xual harassment lawsuit. Despite the payment, Clinton faced no criminal charges. 

Fast forward to 2023, Donald Trump faced 34 felony counts in New York City for allegedly paying Stormy Daniels hush money during his 2016 campaign and was convicted yesterday with a guilty verdict. This stark difference in treatment raises questions about fairness in our legal system.

Why did Clinton escape felony charges while Trump is hit with 34? Is this about justice, or is there a double standard at play? It‚Äôs crucial to scrutinize how our legal system treats different figures under similar circumstances.",187,382,bullying detected

"#NarcissisticAbuse is a devastating form of emotional and psychological abuse caused by someone with high narcissistic traits. It involves a range of manipulative behaviors like gaslighting, blame-shifting, devaluation, and constant belittling and criticism that erodes your self-esteem. The abuser will try to control and isolates you, cutting you off from support and making you feel dependent and powerless. They may alternate between being nice and cruel, leaving you in a constant state of anxiety, desperately seeking their approval. The victim may look like they are lying or crazy when they try to explain what‚Äôs going on because the narcissist‚Äôs two-faced nature is shamelessly hidden behind a mask of charm, lies, manipulation and smear campaigns. This kind of abuse can lead to serious emotional damage, including anxiety, depression, a loss of self-worth, and in extreme cases, C-PTSD, self medication, or suicide. It could be described as covert psychological violence.",288,633,bullying detected

"Theres this false narrative going around that I ‚Äúdefended Nick‚Äù & am therefore ‚Äúpro child neglect/abuse including drugs & swinging‚Äù. This false narrative has been repeated in my mentions for days all because I‚Äôm guilty of not immediately giving my opinion & condemning Nick. Every time I‚Äôve confronted someone accusing me of this I ask for them to provide me with one single receipt and they can‚Äôt because they don‚Äôt exist. You want to get mad because I‚Äôve been on stream with people who have opinions you do or don‚Äôt like & I didn‚Äôt say anything? Well newsflash I rarely chime in to topics I have zero desire to discuss. Just because others have opinions doesn‚Äôt mean I agree with them simply because I‚Äôm in their presence. I think water tastes disgusting; I‚Äôm in fully aware that 99.9% of the population disagrees & that‚Äôs fine. Just because you‚Äôre in my presence doesn‚Äôt mean you automatically share my views(crazy how that works right).

Now another accusation is that I‚Äôm ‚Äúdefending Nick‚Äù because I called out Aaron.  Idk if it‚Äôs willing ignorance or you‚Äôre just not intelligent enough to understand that just because you‚Äôve deemed one person the ultimate villain does not disqualify other monsters in the situation. Before all this started I didn‚Äôt know who tf this guy was. What I saw was a total sleezeball capitalizing on a situation for personal gain at the expense of children. My entire timeline was full of this jackass stirring the pot with disgusting sex stories that had nothing to actually do with the case but were just his ‚Äúinside scoop‚Äù for his 15minutes of fame. It absolutely disgusted me that someone could say the things he did stream after stream with a gigantic smile on his face. He knew those kids & claimed to care but was just a POS that didn‚Äôt do anything & yet still instead of helping them only continued to make their lives worse. They‚Äôre from a small town & this is a huge scandal. They‚Äôre already being judged by everyone around them & anyone including them can look up their last name & find any of the streams/clips of that jackass talking shit about their parents. Now if you still don‚Äôt understand why I would choose to call that shit out idk what to tell you this is something even Forest Gump would understand. 

Lastly all this situation has done has open my eyes to the amount of cancel culture pigs on my timeline. Every single one of you that accused me shit because I kept my opinions to myself are no better than the wackos that went after Gina or anyone else that steps out of line & doesn‚Äôt conform to your ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù. I‚Äôve seen your tweets & know who you are. All of you with the ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not with me then you‚Äôre my enemy‚Äù narrative should really take a step back and think about what you‚Äôre doing because It‚Äôs not good. Maybe take a minute & apply some common sense before demonizing me of ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù I didn‚Äôt commit or making accusations against me because I didn‚Äôt ‚Äústep in line‚Äù in the what you considered is a timely manner.

"Long post warning üö® 

I think I‚Äôve figured out why I‚Äôm so turned off with the current left: they have become the establishment. 

Growing up the Republican Party, with its oppressive brand of moral conservatism, felt like the owners of the ‚Äúestablishment.‚Äù

The hippies and the left were a reaction to that. Free love, rock and roll, anti-war, anti-establishment.  That was followed by punk rock culture ‚Äî liberals continued to be the standard bearers of the antiestablishment. 

Even into the 90s/2000s, you had anti-war liberals pushing back against the Falwell moral majority and protesting the Iraq war (that was me üëã).  Then the pushback to the disastrous neocon political movement of the post-9/11 2000s. 

Then it all started to change. Trump in 2016 flipped everything on its head. Suddenly republicans were much less hawkish, ignoring foreign wars. and the liberals lost their mind with TDS. So everything then became a reaction to trump. 

Then covid hit and things really got weird. 

Liberals started pushing for even greater state control. Forced closures of businesses, executive orders, vaccine mandates, clamping down on constitutional rights. 

And they also started cheering US military action abroad in the Ukraine. Obama started this with his love for drone warfare. Now we see the left cheering the political prosecution of their political opponents. Grim. 

So now, all the sudden, the anti-establishment left of the last 60 years has swung hard to become the people they‚Äôve fought against. 

And there‚Äôs nothing less punk rock than fighting for the establishment.",32,380,bullying detected

"10. Club Friday Season 16: Love Bully (2024)

Episodes: 4
Airs: Jun 7, 2024 - Jun 28, 2024
Airs On: Friday
Original Network: One 31

Main Cast: Charlotte Austin , Engfa Waraha

Plot
In the era of social media, everyone can freely express their opinions about others. They can use harsh words without much consideration, not thinking about the consequences or verifying the truth.

In a relationship between two women, one becomes overly concerned with the opinions of others, making her vulnerable to someone she doesn't know who ends up hurting her. The second woman has never cared much, firmly believing in the adage ""to each their own."" However, at times, she can be remarkably oblivious to the feelings of those around her.

With their love in the spotlight, eyes across the nation scrutinise their every move, passing judgement on ever action.

"I received some hateful comments on my post about Biden. Apparently, I was cruel when I made remarks about his speech and said it made no sense. They say it's ""bullying"" - to write a post about most powerful man in the world, who is trying to save Hamas, so that they'd continue m*rdering, r*ping and kidnapping Israelis.

Isn't it displaced suicidal ""empathy"" that @GadSaad is always talking about?

Powerful white rich man is trying to save horrific monsters from hell, because of his own selfish interests, but I am supposed to be sensitive to his special needs? 

Hamas said that October 7 was great success and they want to continue doing it. To m*rder innocent Israelis, including babies, children, to burn people alive, to ashes, so that it took weeks to identify. To r*pe women while slicing their breasts off and play football with body parts. But sure, the most important is to be kind to a person who wants all this to continue.

Speaking of people with disabilities, many of them were m*rdered, sla*ghtered, r*ped and kidnapped by Hamas.

Ruth Perez with her father Eric were brutally m*rdered by Hamas at music festival. Ruth couldn't walk or talk but music was her life. What kind of monsters don't have mercy for such an innocent disabled girl?

Kapshiter family - parents Dina and Evgeny, and children Alin and Ethan were brutally m*rdered by Hamas monsters, when trying to escape. Hamas savages saw that it is a family with kids in the car, why did they sla*ghter them?? Ethan was a kid with special needs. Alin's body was found in another location weeks after her parents and brother's bodies were found. What did the horrific monsters do to her before m*rdering?

Noya Dan, 13 years old, was autistic girl. Hamas savages dragged her and her grandmother to Gaza border, m*rdered them and dumped their bodies in the dirt.

I have many more examples.
I am thinking about all of them every day.
I can't stop writing about them.
I can't sleep at night.

And white rich supremacist Biden doesn't care. He wants Hamas to win, to recover, to continue. Me, my family, my friends, kids I work with - we all will be the next victims.

"#NarcissisticAbuse is a devastating form of emotional and psychological abuse caused by someone with high narcissistic traits. It involves a range of manipulative behaviors like gaslighting, blame-shifting, devaluation, and constant belittling and criticism that erodes your self-esteem. The abuser will try to control and isolates you, cutting you off from support and making you feel dependent and powerless. They may alternate between being nice and cruel, leaving you in a constant state of anxiety, desperately seeking their approval. The victim may look like they are lying or crazy when they try to explain what‚Äôs going on because the narcissist‚Äôs two-faced nature is shamelessly hidden behind a mask of charm, lies, manipulation and smear campaigns. This kind of abuse can lead to serious emotional damage, including anxiety, depression, a loss of self-worth, and in extreme cases, C-PTSD, self medication, or suicide.

"Long post warning üö® 

I think I‚Äôve figured out why I‚Äôm so turned off with the current left: they have become the establishment. 

Growing up the Republican Party, with its oppressive brand of moral conservatism, felt like the owners of the ‚Äúestablishment.‚Äù

The hippies and the left were a reaction to that. Free love, rock and roll, anti-war, anti-establishment.  That was followed by punk rock culture ‚Äî liberals continued to be the standard bearers of the antiestablishment. 

Even into the 90s/2000s, you had anti-war liberals pushing back against the Falwell moral majority and protesting the Iraq war (that was me üëã).  Then the pushback to the disastrous neocon political movement of the post-9/11 2000s. 

Then it all started to change. Trump in 2016 flipped everything on its head. Suddenly republicans were much less hawkish, ignoring foreign wars. and the liberals lost their mind with TDS. So everything then became a reaction to trump. 

Then covid hit and things really got weird. 

Liberals started pushing for even greater state control. Forced closures of businesses, executive orders, vaccine mandates, clamping down on constitutional rights. 

And they also started cheering US military action abroad in the Ukraine. Obama started this with his love for drone warfare. Now we see the left cheering the political prosecution of their political opponents. Grim. 

So now, all the sudden, the anti-establishment left of the last 60 years has swung hard to become the people they‚Äôve fought against. 

And there‚Äôs nothing less punk rock than fighting for the establishment.",32,383,bullying detected

"10. Club Friday Season 16: Love Bully (2024)

Episodes: 4
Airs: Jun 7, 2024 - Jun 28, 2024
Airs On: Friday
Original Network: One 31

Main Cast: Charlotte Austin , Engfa Waraha

Plot
In the era of social media, everyone can freely express their opinions about others. They can use harsh words without much consideration, not thinking about the consequences or verifying the truth.

In a relationship between two women, one becomes overly concerned with the opinions of others, making her vulnerable to someone she doesn't know who ends up hurting her. The second woman has never cared much, firmly believing in the adage ""to each their own."" However, at times, she can be remarkably oblivious to the feelings of those around her.

With their love in the spotlight, eyes across the nation scrutinise their every move, passing judgement on ever action.

This false narrative has been repeated in my mentions for days all because I‚Äôm guilty of not immediately giving my opinion & condemning Nick. Every time I‚Äôve confronted someone accusing me of this I ask for them to provide me with one single receipt and they can‚Äôt because they don‚Äôt exist. You want to get mad because I‚Äôve been on stream with people who have opinions you do or don‚Äôt like & I didn‚Äôt say anything? Well newsflash I rarely chime in to topics I have zero desire to discuss. Just because others have opinions doesn‚Äôt mean I agree with them simply because I‚Äôm in their presence. I think water tastes disgusting; I‚Äôm in fully aware that 99.9% of the population disagrees & that‚Äôs fine. Just because you‚Äôre in my presence doesn‚Äôt mean you automatically share my views(crazy how that works right).

Now another accusation is that I‚Äôm ‚Äúdefending Nick‚Äù because I called out Aaron.  Idk if it‚Äôs willing ignorance or you‚Äôre just not intelligent enough to understand that just because you‚Äôve deemed one person the ultimate villain does not disqualify other monsters in the situation. Before all this started I didn‚Äôt know who tf this guy was. What I saw was a total sleezeball capitalizing on a situation for personal gain at the expense of children. My entire timeline was full of this jackass stirring the pot with disgusting sex stories that had nothing to actually do with the case but were just his ‚Äúinside scoop‚Äù for his 15minutes of fame. It absolutely disgusted me that someone could say the things he did stream after stream with a gigantic smile on his face. He knew those kids & claimed to care but was just a POS that didn‚Äôt do anything & yet still instead of helping them only continued to make their lives worse. They‚Äôre from a small town & this is a huge scandal. They‚Äôre already being judged by everyone around them & anyone including them can look up their last name & find any of the streams/clips of that jackass talking shit about their parents. Now if you still don‚Äôt understand why I would choose to call that shit out idk what to tell you this is something even Forest Gump would understand. 

Lastly all this situation has done has open my eyes to the amount of cancel culture pigs on my timeline. Every single one of you that accused me shit because I kept my opinions to myself are no better than the wackos that went after Gina or anyone else that steps out of line & doesn‚Äôt conform to your ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù. I‚Äôve seen your tweets & know who you are. All of you with the ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not with me then you‚Äôre my enemy‚Äù narrative should really take a step back and think about what you‚Äôre doing because It‚Äôs not good. Maybe take a minute & apply some common sense before demonizing me of ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù I didn‚Äôt commit or making accusations against me because I didn‚Äôt ‚Äústep in line‚Äù in the what you considered is a timely manner. Canceling me over your imaginary opinions won‚Äôt end well & forcing me to bend the knee to your will is only going to end in disappointment for you. I don‚Äôt put up with that kind of bs & I never will. 

At the end of the day my opinion on this really doesn‚Äôt matter nor will it change a single thing. Those kids have seen enough & me adding to it ultimately will not help.

Quaden Bayles, an Australian indigenous boy, became the focus of a viral video in 2020. Quaden was born with achondroplasia, a form of dwarfism. 

The video, which gained global attention, was filmed by his mother, Yarraka Bayles, on February 19, 2020. It shows Quaden in a highly distressed state, crying uncontrollably in the back of a car after a day at school where he was bullied.

Isn't it displaced suicidal ""empathy"" that @GadSaad is always talking about?

Powerful white rich man is trying to save horrific monsters from hell, because of his own selfish interests, but I am supposed to be sensitive to his special needs? 

Hamas said that October 7 was great success and they want to continue doing it. To m*rder innocent Israelis, including babies, children, to burn people alive, to ashes, so that it took weeks to identify. To r*pe women while slicing their breasts off and play football with body parts. But sure, the most important is to be kind to a person who wants all this to continue.

Speaking of people with disabilities, many of them were m*rdered, sla*ghtered, r*ped and kidnapped by Hamas.

Ruth Perez with her father Eric were brutally m*rdered by Hamas at music festival. Ruth couldn't walk or talk but music was her life. What kind of monsters don't have mercy for such an innocent disabled girl?

Kapshiter family - parents Dina and Evgeny, and children Alin and Ethan were brutally m*rdered by Hamas monsters, when trying to escape. Hamas savages saw that it is a family with kids in the car, why did they sla*ghter them?? Ethan was a kid with special needs. Alin's body was found in another location weeks after her parents and brother's bodies were found. What did the horrific monsters do to her before m*rdering?

Noya Dan, 13 years old, was autistic girl. Hamas savages dragged her and her grandmother to Gaza border, m*rdered them and dumped their bodies in the dirt.

I have many more examples.
I am thinking about all of them every day.
I can't stop writing about them.
I can't sleep at night.

And white rich supremacist Biden doesn't care. He wants Hamas to win, to recover, to continue. Me, my family, my friends, kids I work with - we all will be the next victims.

"Long post warning üö® 

I think I‚Äôve figured out why I‚Äôm so turned off with the current left: they have become the establishment. 

Growing up the Republican Party, with its oppressive brand of moral conservatism, felt like the owners of the ‚Äúestablishment.‚Äù

The hippies and the left were a reaction to that. Free love, rock and roll, anti-war, anti-establishment.  That was followed by punk rock culture ‚Äî liberals continued to be the standard bearers of the antiestablishment. 

Even into the 90s/2000s, you had anti-war liberals pushing back against the Falwell moral majority and protesting the Iraq war (that was me üëã).  Then the pushback to the disastrous neocon political movement of the post-9/11 2000s. 

Then it all started to change. Trump in 2016 flipped everything on its head. Suddenly republicans were much less hawkish, ignoring foreign wars. and the liberals lost their mind with TDS. So everything then became a reaction to trump. 

Then covid hit and things really got weird. 

Liberals started pushing for even greater state control. Forced closures of businesses, executive orders, vaccine mandates, clamping down on constitutional rights. 

And they also started cheering US military action abroad in the Ukraine. Obama started this with his love for drone warfare. Now we see the left cheering the political prosecution of their political opponents. Grim. 

So now, all the sudden, the anti-establishment left of the last 60 years has swung hard to become the people they‚Äôve fought against. 

And there‚Äôs nothing less punk rock than fighting for the establishment.",32,383,bullying detected

"10. Club Friday Season 16: Love Bully (2024)

Episodes: 4
Airs: Jun 7, 2024 - Jun 28, 2024
Airs On: Friday
Original Network: One 31

Main Cast: Charlotte Austin , Engfa Waraha

Plot
In the era of social media, everyone can freely express their opinions about others. They can use harsh words without much consideration, not thinking about the consequences or verifying the truth.

In a relationship between two women, one becomes overly concerned with the opinions of others, making her vulnerable to someone she doesn't know who ends up hurting her. The second woman has never cared much, firmly believing in the adage ""to each their own."" However, at times, she can be remarkably oblivious to the feelings of those around her.

With their love in the spotlight, eyes across the nation scrutinise their every move, passing judgement on ever action.

"Theres this false narrative going around that I ‚Äúdefended Nick‚Äù & am therefore ‚Äúpro child neglect/abuse including drugs & swinging‚Äù. This false narrative has been repeated in my mentions for days all because I‚Äôm guilty of not immediately giving my opinion & condemning Nick. Every time I‚Äôve confronted someone accusing me of this I ask for them to provide me with one single receipt and they can‚Äôt because they don‚Äôt exist. You want to get mad because I‚Äôve been on stream with people who have opinions you do or don‚Äôt like & I didn‚Äôt say anything? Well newsflash I rarely chime in to topics I have zero desire to discuss. Just because others have opinions doesn‚Äôt mean I agree with them simply because I‚Äôm in their presence. I think water tastes disgusting; I‚Äôm in fully aware that 99.9% of the population disagrees & that‚Äôs fine. Just because you‚Äôre in my presence doesn‚Äôt mean you automatically share my views(crazy how that works right).

Now another accusation is that I‚Äôm ‚Äúdefending Nick‚Äù because I called out Aaron.  Idk if it‚Äôs willing ignorance or you‚Äôre just not intelligent enough to understand that just because you‚Äôve deemed one person the ultimate villain does not disqualify other monsters in the situation. Before all this started I didn‚Äôt know who tf this guy was. What I saw was a total sleezeball capitalizing on a situation for personal gain at the expense of children. My entire timeline was full of this jackass stirring the pot with disgusting sex stories that had nothing to actually do with the case but were just his ‚Äúinside scoop‚Äù for his 15minutes of fame. It absolutely disgusted me that someone could say the things he did stream after stream with a gigantic smile on his face. He knew those kids & claimed to care but was just a POS that didn‚Äôt do anything & yet still instead of helping them only continued to make their lives worse. They‚Äôre from a small town & this is a huge scandal. They‚Äôre already being judged by everyone around them & anyone including them can look up their last name & find any of the streams/clips of that jackass talking shit about their parents. Now if you still don‚Äôt understand why I would choose to call that shit out idk what to tell you this is something even Forest Gump would understand. 

Lastly all this situation has done has open my eyes to the amount of cancel culture pigs on my timeline. Every single one of you that accused me shit because I kept my opinions to myself are no better than the wackos that went after Gina or anyone else that steps out of line & doesn‚Äôt conform to your ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù. I‚Äôve seen your tweets & know who you are. All of you with the ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not with me then you‚Äôre my enemy‚Äù narrative should really take a step back and think about what you‚Äôre doing because It‚Äôs not good. Maybe take a minute & apply some common sense before demonizing me of ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù I didn‚Äôt commit or making accusations against me because I didn‚Äôt ‚Äústep in line‚Äù in the what you considered is a timely manner. Canceling me over your imaginary opinions won‚Äôt end well & forcing me to bend the knee to your will is only going to end in disappointment for you. I don‚Äôt put up with that kind of bs & I never will. 

At the end of the day my opinion on this really doesn‚Äôt matter nor will it change a single thing. Those kids have seen enough & me adding to it ultimately will not help. Everyone that actually knows me knows where I stand on this including Nick. Going after me with pitchforks because you want blood isn‚Äôt going to solve anything.

"Glad to see Quaden is doing well after everything the poor kid endured from bullies...at school & online!

More context:
Quaden Bayles, an Australian indigenous boy, became the focus of a viral video in 2020. Quaden was born with achondroplasia, a form of dwarfism. 

The video, which gained global attention, was filmed by his mother, Yarraka Bayles, on February 19, 2020. It shows Quaden in a highly distressed state, crying uncontrollably in the back of a car after a day at school where he was bullied. 

The emotional intensity of the video is evident as Quaden expresses a desire to harm himself, saying, ‚ÄúI wish I could stab myself in the heart‚Äù and ‚ÄúGive me a knife, I want to k*ll myself‚Äù‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã.

This video resonated with millions around the world, highlighting the severe impact of bullying on young individuals, particularly those with physical differences.

To make matters even worse, cyber bullies attacked the family and made false claims about Quaden's age. 

This üëáüèº is the original video. It's truly heartbreaking üò™",39,388,bullying detected

"I received some hateful comments on my post about Biden. Apparently, I was cruel when I made remarks about his speech and said it made no sense. They say it's ""bullying"" - to write a post about most powerful man in the world, who is trying to save Hamas, so that they'd continue m*rdering, r*ping and kidnapping Israelis.

Isn't it displaced suicidal ""empathy"" that @GadSaad is always talking about?

Powerful white rich man is trying to save horrific monsters from hell, because of his own selfish interests, but I am supposed to be sensitive to his special needs? 

Hamas said that October 7 was great success and they want to continue doing it. To m*rder innocent Israelis, including babies, children, to burn people alive, to ashes, so that it took weeks to identify. To r*pe women while slicing their breasts off and play football with body parts. But sure, the most important is to be kind to a person who wants all this to continue.

Speaking of people with disabilities, many of them were m*rdered, sla*ghtered, r*ped and kidnapped by Hamas.

Ruth Perez with her father Eric were brutally m*rdered by Hamas at music festival. Ruth couldn't walk or talk but music was her life. What kind of monsters don't have mercy for such an innocent disabled girl?

Kapshiter family - parents Dina and Evgeny, and children Alin and Ethan were brutally m*rdered by Hamas monsters, when trying to escape. Hamas savages saw that it is a family with kids in the car, why did they sla*ghter them?? Ethan was a kid with special needs. Alin's body was found in another location weeks after her parents and brother's bodies were found. What did the horrific monsters do to her before m*rdering?

Noya Dan, 13 years old, was autistic girl. Hamas savages dragged her and her grandmother to Gaza border, m*rdered them and dumped their bodies in the dirt.

I have many more examples.
I am thinking about all of them every day.
I can't stop writing about them.
I can't sleep at night.

And white rich supremacist Biden doesn't care. He wants Hamas to win, to recover, to continue. Me, my family, my friends, kids I work with - we all will be the next victims. 

I was quiet about Biden for 8 months, hoping that maybe he cares, a bit. But no. He doesn't.

"Long post warning üö® 

I think I‚Äôve figured out why I‚Äôm so turned off with the current left: they have become the establishment. 

Growing up the Republican Party, with its oppressive brand of moral conservatism, felt like the owners of the ‚Äúestablishment.‚Äù

The hippies and the left were a reaction to that. Free love, rock and roll, anti-war, anti-establishment.  That was followed by punk rock culture ‚Äî liberals continued to be the standard bearers of the antiestablishment. 

Even into the 90s/2000s, you had anti-war liberals pushing back against the Falwell moral majority and protesting the Iraq war (that was me üëã).  Then the pushback to the disastrous neocon political movement of the post-9/11 2000s. 

Then it all started to change. Trump in 2016 flipped everything on its head. Suddenly republicans were much less hawkish, ignoring foreign wars. and the liberals lost their mind with TDS. So everything then became a reaction to trump. 

Then covid hit and things really got weird. 

Liberals started pushing for even greater state control. Forced closures of businesses, executive orders, vaccine mandates, clamping down on constitutional rights. 

And they also started cheering US military action abroad in the Ukraine. Obama started this with his love for drone warfare. Now we see the left cheering the political prosecution of their political opponents. Grim. 

So now, all the sudden, the anti-establishment left of the last 60 years has swung hard to become the people they‚Äôve fought against.

"10. Club Friday Season 16: Love Bully (2024)

Episodes: 4
Airs: Jun 7, 2024 - Jun 28, 2024
Airs On: Friday
Original Network: One 31

Main Cast: Charlotte Austin , Engfa Waraha

Plot
In the era of social media, everyone can freely express their opinions about others. They can use harsh words without much consideration, not thinking about the consequences or verifying the truth.

In a relationship between two women, one becomes overly concerned with the opinions of others, making her vulnerable to someone she doesn't know who ends up hurting her. The second woman has never cared much, firmly believing in the adage ""to each their own."" However, at times, she can be remarkably oblivious to the feelings of those around her.

"Theres this false narrative going around that I ‚Äúdefended Nick‚Äù & am therefore ‚Äúpro child neglect/abuse including drugs & swinging‚Äù. This false narrative has been repeated in my mentions for days all because I‚Äôm guilty of not immediately giving my opinion & condemning Nick. Every time I‚Äôve confronted someone accusing me of this I ask for them to provide me with one single receipt and they can‚Äôt because they don‚Äôt exist. You want to get mad because I‚Äôve been on stream with people who have opinions you do or don‚Äôt like & I didn‚Äôt say anything? Well newsflash I rarely chime in to topics I have zero desire to discuss. Just because others have opinions doesn‚Äôt mean I agree with them simply because I‚Äôm in their presence. I think water tastes disgusting; I‚Äôm in fully aware that 99.9% of the population disagrees & that‚Äôs fine. Just because you‚Äôre in my presence doesn‚Äôt mean you automatically share my views(crazy how that works right).

Now another accusation is that I‚Äôm ‚Äúdefending Nick‚Äù because I called out Aaron.  Idk if it‚Äôs willing ignorance or you‚Äôre just not intelligent enough to understand that just because you‚Äôve deemed one person the ultimate villain does not disqualify other monsters in the situation. Before all this started I didn‚Äôt know who tf this guy was. What I saw was a total sleezeball capitalizing on a situation for personal gain at the expense of children. My entire timeline was full of this jackass stirring the pot with disgusting sex stories that had nothing to actually do with the case but were just his ‚Äúinside scoop‚Äù for his 15minutes of fame. It absolutely disgusted me that someone could say the things he did stream after stream with a gigantic smile on his face. He knew those kids & claimed to care but was just a POS that didn‚Äôt do anything & yet still instead of helping them only continued to make their lives worse. They‚Äôre from a small town & this is a huge scandal. They‚Äôre already being judged by everyone around them & anyone including them can look up their last name & find any of the streams/clips of that jackass talking shit about their parents. Now if you still don‚Äôt understand why I would choose to call that shit out idk what to tell you this is something even Forest Gump would understand. 

Lastly all this situation has done has open my eyes to the amount of cancel culture pigs on my timeline. Every single one of you that accused me shit because I kept my opinions to myself are no better than the wackos that went after Gina or anyone else that steps out of line & doesn‚Äôt conform to your ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù. I‚Äôve seen your tweets & know who you are. All of you with the ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not with me then you‚Äôre my enemy‚Äù narrative should really take a step back and think about what you‚Äôre doing because It‚Äôs not good. Maybe take a minute & apply some common sense before demonizing me of ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù I didn‚Äôt commit or making accusations against me because I didn‚Äôt ‚Äústep in line‚Äù in the what you considered is a timely manner. Canceling me over your imaginary opinions won‚Äôt end well & forcing me to bend the knee to your will is only going to end in disappointment for you. I don‚Äôt put up with that kind of bs & I never will. 

At the end of the day my opinion on this really doesn‚Äôt matter nor will it change a single thing. Those kids have seen enough & me adding to it ultimately will not help. Everyone that actually knows me knows where I stand on this including Nick. Going after me with pitchforks because you want blood isn‚Äôt going to solve anything. It just exposes you cancel pigs for who you truly are.",43,716,bullying detected

"Glad to see Quaden is doing well after everything the poor kid endured from bullies...at school & online!

More context:
Quaden Bayles, an Australian indigenous boy, became the focus of a viral video in 2020. Quaden was born with achondroplasia, a form of dwarfism. 

The video, which gained global attention, was filmed by his mother, Yarraka Bayles, on February 19, 2020. It shows Quaden in a highly distressed state, crying uncontrollably in the back of a car after a day at school where he was bullied. 

The emotional intensity of the video is evident as Quaden expresses a desire to harm himself, saying, ‚ÄúI wish I could stab myself in the heart‚Äù and ‚ÄúGive me a knife, I want to k*ll myself‚Äù‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã.

This video resonated with millions around the world, highlighting the severe impact of bullying on young individuals, particularly those with physical differences.

To make matters even worse, cyber bullies attacked the family and made false claims about Quaden's age.

"#NarcissisticAbuse is a devastating form of emotional and psychological abuse caused by someone with high narcissistic traits. It involves a range of manipulative behaviors like gaslighting, blame-shifting, devaluation, and constant belittling and criticism that erodes your self-esteem. The abuser will try to control and isolates you, cutting you off from support and making you feel dependent and powerless. They may alternate between being nice and cruel, leaving you in a constant state of anxiety, desperately seeking their approval. The victim may look like they are lying or crazy when they try to explain what‚Äôs going on because the narcissist‚Äôs two-faced nature is shamelessly hidden behind a mask of charm, lies, manipulation and smear campaigns. This kind of abuse can lead to serious emotional damage, including anxiety, depression, a loss of self-worth, and in extreme cases, C-PTSD, self medication, or suicide.

Every time I‚Äôve confronted someone accusing me of this I ask for them to provide me with one single receipt and they can‚Äôt because they don‚Äôt exist. You want to get mad because I‚Äôve been on stream with people who have opinions you do or don‚Äôt like & I didn‚Äôt say anything? Well newsflash I rarely chime in to topics I have zero desire to discuss. Just because others have opinions doesn‚Äôt mean I agree with them simply because I‚Äôm in their presence. I think water tastes disgusting; I‚Äôm in fully aware that 99.9% of the population disagrees & that‚Äôs fine. Just because you‚Äôre in my presence doesn‚Äôt mean you automatically share my views(crazy how that works right).

Now another accusation is that I‚Äôm ‚Äúdefending Nick‚Äù because I called out Aaron.  Idk if it‚Äôs willing ignorance or you‚Äôre just not intelligent enough to understand that just because you‚Äôve deemed one person the ultimate villain does not disqualify other monsters in the situation. Before all this started I didn‚Äôt know who tf this guy was. What I saw was a total sleezeball capitalizing on a situation for personal gain at the expense of children. My entire timeline was full of this jackass stirring the pot with disgusting sex stories that had nothing to actually do with the case but were just his ‚Äúinside scoop‚Äù for his 15minutes of fame. It absolutely disgusted me that someone could say the things he did stream after stream with a gigantic smile on his face. He knew those kids & claimed to care but was just a POS that didn‚Äôt do anything & yet still instead of helping them only continued to make their lives worse. They‚Äôre from a small town & this is a huge scandal. They‚Äôre already being judged by everyone around them & anyone including them can look up their last name & find any of the streams/clips of that jackass talking shit about their parents. Now if you still don‚Äôt understand why I would choose to call that shit out idk what to tell you this is something even Forest Gump would understand. 

Lastly all this situation has done has open my eyes to the amount of cancel culture pigs on my timeline. Every single one of you that accused me shit because I kept my opinions to myself are no better than the wackos that went after Gina or anyone else that steps out of line & doesn‚Äôt conform to your ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù. I‚Äôve seen your tweets & know who you are. All of you with the ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not with me then you‚Äôre my enemy‚Äù narrative should really take a step back and think about what you‚Äôre doing because It‚Äôs not good. Maybe take a minute & apply some common sense before demonizing me of ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù I didn‚Äôt commit or making accusations against me because I didn‚Äôt ‚Äústep in line‚Äù in the what you considered is a timely manner. Canceling me over your imaginary opinions won‚Äôt end well & forcing me to bend the knee to your will is only going to end in disappointment for you. I don‚Äôt put up with that kind of bs & I never will. 

At the end of the day my opinion on this really doesn‚Äôt matter nor will it change a single thing. Those kids have seen enough & me adding to it ultimately will not help. Everyone that actually knows me knows where I stand on this including Nick. Going after me with pitchforks because you want blood isn‚Äôt going to solve anything.

"Long post warning üö® 

I think I‚Äôve figured out why I‚Äôm so turned off with the current left: they have become the establishment. 

Growing up the Republican Party, with its oppressive brand of moral conservatism, felt like the owners of the ‚Äúestablishment.‚Äù

The hippies and the left were a reaction to that. Free love, rock and roll, anti-war, anti-establishment.  That was followed by punk rock culture ‚Äî liberals continued to be the standard bearers of the antiestablishment. 

Even into the 90s/2000s, you had anti-war liberals pushing back against the Falwell moral majority and protesting the Iraq war (that was me üëã).  Then the pushback to the disastrous neocon political movement of the post-9/11 2000s. 

Then it all started to change. Trump in 2016 flipped everything on its head. Suddenly republicans were much less hawkish, ignoring foreign wars. and the liberals lost their mind with TDS. So everything then became a reaction to trump. 

Then covid hit and things really got weird. 

Liberals started pushing for even greater state control. Forced closures of businesses, executive orders, vaccine mandates, clamping down on constitutional rights. 

And they also started cheering US military action abroad in the Ukraine. Obama started this with his love for drone warfare. Now we see the left cheering the political prosecution of their political opponents. Grim. 

So now, all the sudden, the anti-establishment left of the last 60 years has swung hard to become the people they‚Äôve fought against.

Episodes: 4
Airs: Jun 7, 2024 - Jun 28, 2024
Airs On: Friday
Original Network: One 31

Main Cast: Charlotte Austin , Engfa Waraha

Plot
In the era of social media, everyone can freely express their opinions about others. They can use harsh words without much consideration, not thinking about the consequences or verifying the truth.

In a relationship between two women, one becomes overly concerned with the opinions of others, making her vulnerable to someone she doesn't know who ends up hurting her. The second woman has never cared much, firmly believing in the adage ""to each their own."" However, at times, she can be remarkably oblivious to the feelings of those around her.

With their love in the spotlight, eyes across the nation scrutinise their every move, passing judgement on ever action.

"#NarcissisticAbuse is a devastating form of emotional and psychological abuse caused by someone with high narcissistic traits. It involves a range of manipulative behaviors like gaslighting, blame-shifting, devaluation, and constant belittling and criticism that erodes your self-esteem. The abuser will try to control and isolates you, cutting you off from support and making you feel dependent and powerless. They may alternate between being nice and cruel, leaving you in a constant state of anxiety, desperately seeking their approval. The victim may look like they are lying or crazy when they try to explain what‚Äôs going on because the narcissist‚Äôs two-faced nature is shamelessly hidden behind a mask of charm, lies, manipulation and smear campaigns. This kind of abuse can lead to serious emotional damage, including anxiety, depression, a loss of self-worth, and in extreme cases, C-PTSD, self medication, or suicide.

Quaden Bayles, an Australian indigenous boy, became the focus of a viral video in 2020. Quaden was born with achondroplasia, a form of dwarfism. 

The video, which gained global attention, was filmed by his mother, Yarraka Bayles, on February 19, 2020. It shows Quaden in a highly distressed state, crying uncontrollably in the back of a car after a day at school where he was bullied.

"Theres this false narrative going around that I ‚Äúdefended Nick‚Äù & am therefore ‚Äúpro child neglect/abuse including drugs & swinging‚Äù. This false narrative has been repeated in my mentions for days all because I‚Äôm guilty of not immediately giving my opinion & condemning Nick. Every time I‚Äôve confronted someone accusing me of this I ask for them to provide me with one single receipt and they can‚Äôt because they don‚Äôt exist. You want to get mad because I‚Äôve been on stream with people who have opinions you do or don‚Äôt like & I didn‚Äôt say anything? Well newsflash I rarely chime in to topics I have zero desire to discuss. Just because others have opinions doesn‚Äôt mean I agree with them simply because I‚Äôm in their presence. I think water tastes disgusting; I‚Äôm in fully aware that 99.9% of the population disagrees & that‚Äôs fine. Just because you‚Äôre in my presence doesn‚Äôt mean you automatically share my views(crazy how that works right).

Now another accusation is that I‚Äôm ‚Äúdefending Nick‚Äù because I called out Aaron.  Idk if it‚Äôs willing ignorance or you‚Äôre just not intelligent enough to understand that just because you‚Äôve deemed one person the ultimate villain does not disqualify other monsters in the situation. Before all this started I didn‚Äôt know who tf this guy was. What I saw was a total sleezeball capitalizing on a situation for personal gain at the expense of children. My entire timeline was full of this jackass stirring the pot with disgusting sex stories that had nothing to actually do with the case but were just his ‚Äúinside scoop‚Äù for his 15minutes of fame. It absolutely disgusted me that someone could say the things he did stream after stream with a gigantic smile on his face. He knew those kids & claimed to care but was just a POS that didn‚Äôt do anything & yet still instead of helping them only continued to make their lives worse. They‚Äôre from a small town & this is a huge scandal. They‚Äôre already being judged by everyone around them & anyone including them can look up their last name & find any of the streams/clips of that jackass talking shit about their parents. Now if you still don‚Äôt understand why I would choose to call that shit out idk what to tell you this is something even Forest Gump would understand. 

Lastly all this situation has done has open my eyes to the amount of cancel culture pigs on my timeline. Every single one of you that accused me shit because I kept my opinions to myself are no better than the wackos that went after Gina or anyone else that steps out of line & doesn‚Äôt conform to your ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù. I‚Äôve seen your tweets & know who you are. All of you with the ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not with me then you‚Äôre my enemy‚Äù narrative should really take a step back and think about what you‚Äôre doing because It‚Äôs not good. Maybe take a minute & apply some common sense before demonizing me of ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù I didn‚Äôt commit or making accusations against me because I didn‚Äôt ‚Äústep in line‚Äù in the what you considered is a timely manner. Canceling me over your imaginary opinions won‚Äôt end well & forcing me to bend the knee to your will is only going to end in disappointment for you. I don‚Äôt put up with that kind of bs & I never will. 

At the end of the day my opinion on this really doesn‚Äôt matter nor will it change a single thing. Those kids have seen enough & me adding to it ultimately will not help. Everyone that actually knows me knows where I stand on this including Nick. Going after me with pitchforks because you want blood isn‚Äôt going to solve anything. It just exposes you cancel pigs for who you truly are.",43,722,bullying detected

"Long post warning üö® 

I think I‚Äôve figured out why I‚Äôm so turned off with the current left: they have become the establishment. 

Growing up the Republican Party, with its oppressive brand of moral conservatism, felt like the owners of the ‚Äúestablishment.‚Äù

The hippies and the left were a reaction to that. Free love, rock and roll, anti-war, anti-establishment.  That was followed by punk rock culture ‚Äî liberals continued to be the standard bearers of the antiestablishment. 

Even into the 90s/2000s, you had anti-war liberals pushing back against the Falwell moral majority and protesting the Iraq war (that was me üëã).  Then the pushback to the disastrous neocon political movement of the post-9/11 2000s. 

Then it all started to change. Trump in 2016 flipped everything on its head. Suddenly republicans were much less hawkish, ignoring foreign wars. and the liberals lost their mind with TDS. So everything then became a reaction to trump. 

Then covid hit and things really got weird. 

Liberals started pushing for even greater state control. Forced closures of businesses, executive orders, vaccine mandates, clamping down on constitutional rights. 

And they also started cheering US military action abroad in the Ukraine. Obama started this with his love for drone warfare. Now we see the left cheering the political prosecution of their political opponents. Grim. 

So now, all the sudden, the anti-establishment left of the last 60 years has swung hard to become the people they‚Äôve fought against.

Episodes: 4
Airs: Jun 7, 2024 - Jun 28, 2024
Airs On: Friday
Original Network: One 31

Main Cast: Charlotte Austin , Engfa Waraha

Plot
In the era of social media, everyone can freely express their opinions about others. They can use harsh words without much consideration, not thinking about the consequences or verifying the truth.

In a relationship between two women, one becomes overly concerned with the opinions of others, making her vulnerable to someone she doesn't know who ends up hurting her. The second woman has never cared much, firmly believing in the adage ""to each their own."" However, at times, she can be remarkably oblivious to the feelings of those around her.

With their love in the spotlight, eyes across the nation scrutinise their every move, passing judgement on ever action.

Isn't it displaced suicidal ""empathy"" that @GadSaad is always talking about?

Powerful white rich man is trying to save horrific monsters from hell, because of his own selfish interests, but I am supposed to be sensitive to his special needs? 

Hamas said that October 7 was great success and they want to continue doing it. To m*rder innocent Israelis, including babies, children, to burn people alive, to ashes, so that it took weeks to identify. To r*pe women while slicing their breasts off and play football with body parts. But sure, the most important is to be kind to a person who wants all this to continue.

Speaking of people with disabilities, many of them were m*rdered, sla*ghtered, r*ped and kidnapped by Hamas.

Ruth Perez with her father Eric were brutally m*rdered by Hamas at music festival. Ruth couldn't walk or talk but music was her life. What kind of monsters don't have mercy for such an innocent disabled girl?

Kapshiter family - parents Dina and Evgeny, and children Alin and Ethan were brutally m*rdered by Hamas monsters, when trying to escape. Hamas savages saw that it is a family with kids in the car, why did they sla*ghter them?? Ethan was a kid with special needs. Alin's body was found in another location weeks after her parents and brother's bodies were found. What did the horrific monsters do to her before m*rdering?

Noya Dan, 13 years old, was autistic girl. Hamas savages dragged her and her grandmother to Gaza border, m*rdered them and dumped their bodies in the dirt.

I have many more examples.
I am thinking about all of them every day.
I can't stop writing about them.
I can't sleep at night.

And white rich supremacist Biden doesn't care. He wants Hamas to win, to recover, to continue. Me, my family, my friends, kids I work with - we all will be the next victims.

Every time I‚Äôve confronted someone accusing me of this I ask for them to provide me with one single receipt and they can‚Äôt because they don‚Äôt exist. You want to get mad because I‚Äôve been on stream with people who have opinions you do or don‚Äôt like & I didn‚Äôt say anything? Well newsflash I rarely chime in to topics I have zero desire to discuss. Just because others have opinions doesn‚Äôt mean I agree with them simply because I‚Äôm in their presence. I think water tastes disgusting; I‚Äôm in fully aware that 99.9% of the population disagrees & that‚Äôs fine. Just because you‚Äôre in my presence doesn‚Äôt mean you automatically share my views(crazy how that works right).

Now another accusation is that I‚Äôm ‚Äúdefending Nick‚Äù because I called out Aaron.  Idk if it‚Äôs willing ignorance or you‚Äôre just not intelligent enough to understand that just because you‚Äôve deemed one person the ultimate villain does not disqualify other monsters in the situation. Before all this started I didn‚Äôt know who tf this guy was. What I saw was a total sleezeball capitalizing on a situation for personal gain at the expense of children. My entire timeline was full of this jackass stirring the pot with disgusting sex stories that had nothing to actually do with the case but were just his ‚Äúinside scoop‚Äù for his 15minutes of fame. It absolutely disgusted me that someone could say the things he did stream after stream with a gigantic smile on his face. He knew those kids & claimed to care but was just a POS that didn‚Äôt do anything & yet still instead of helping them only continued to make their lives worse. They‚Äôre from a small town & this is a huge scandal. They‚Äôre already being judged by everyone around them & anyone including them can look up their last name & find any of the streams/clips of that jackass talking shit about their parents. Now if you still don‚Äôt understand why I would choose to call that shit out idk what to tell you this is something even Forest Gump would understand. 

Lastly all this situation has done has open my eyes to the amount of cancel culture pigs on my timeline. Every single one of you that accused me shit because I kept my opinions to myself are no better than the wackos that went after Gina or anyone else that steps out of line & doesn‚Äôt conform to your ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù. I‚Äôve seen your tweets & know who you are. All of you with the ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not with me then you‚Äôre my enemy‚Äù narrative should really take a step back and think about what you‚Äôre doing because It‚Äôs not good. Maybe take a minute & apply some common sense before demonizing me of ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù I didn‚Äôt commit or making accusations against me because I didn‚Äôt ‚Äústep in line‚Äù in the what you considered is a timely manner. Canceling me over your imaginary opinions won‚Äôt end well & forcing me to bend the knee to your will is only going to end in disappointment for you. I don‚Äôt put up with that kind of bs & I never will. 

At the end of the day my opinion on this really doesn‚Äôt matter nor will it change a single thing. Those kids have seen enough & me adding to it ultimately will not help.

"Long post warning üö® 

I think I‚Äôve figured out why I‚Äôm so turned off with the current left: they have become the establishment. 

Growing up the Republican Party, with its oppressive brand of moral conservatism, felt like the owners of the ‚Äúestablishment.‚Äù

The hippies and the left were a reaction to that. Free love, rock and roll, anti-war, anti-establishment.  That was followed by punk rock culture ‚Äî liberals continued to be the standard bearers of the antiestablishment. 

Even into the 90s/2000s, you had anti-war liberals pushing back against the Falwell moral majority and protesting the Iraq war (that was me üëã).  Then the pushback to the disastrous neocon political movement of the post-9/11 2000s. 

Then it all started to change. Trump in 2016 flipped everything on its head. Suddenly republicans were much less hawkish, ignoring foreign wars. and the liberals lost their mind with TDS. So everything then became a reaction to trump. 

Then covid hit and things really got weird. 

Liberals started pushing for even greater state control. Forced closures of businesses, executive orders, vaccine mandates, clamping down on constitutional rights. 

And they also started cheering US military action abroad in the Ukraine. Obama started this with his love for drone warfare. Now we see the left cheering the political prosecution of their political opponents. Grim. 

So now, all the sudden, the anti-establishment left of the last 60 years has swung hard to become the people they‚Äôve fought against.

"10. Club Friday Season 16: Love Bully (2024)

Episodes: 4
Airs: Jun 7, 2024 - Jun 28, 2024
Airs On: Friday
Original Network: One 31

Main Cast: Charlotte Austin , Engfa Waraha

Plot
In the era of social media, everyone can freely express their opinions about others. They can use harsh words without much consideration, not thinking about the consequences or verifying the truth.

In a relationship between two women, one becomes overly concerned with the opinions of others, making her vulnerable to someone she doesn't know who ends up hurting her. The second woman has never cared much, firmly believing in the adage ""to each their own."" However, at times, she can be remarkably oblivious to the feelings of those around her.

With their love in the spotlight, eyes across the nation scrutinise their every move, passing judgement on ever action.

I think I‚Äôve figured out why I‚Äôm so turned off with the current left: they have become the establishment. 

Growing up the Republican Party, with its oppressive brand of moral conservatism, felt like the owners of the ‚Äúestablishment.‚Äù

The hippies and the left were a reaction to that. Free love, rock and roll, anti-war, anti-establishment.  That was followed by punk rock culture ‚Äî liberals continued to be the standard bearers of the antiestablishment. 

Even into the 90s/2000s, you had anti-war liberals pushing back against the Falwell moral majority and protesting the Iraq war (that was me üëã).  Then the pushback to the disastrous neocon political movement of the post-9/11 2000s. 

Then it all started to change. Trump in 2016 flipped everything on its head. Suddenly republicans were much less hawkish, ignoring foreign wars. and the liberals lost their mind with TDS. So everything then became a reaction to trump. 

Then covid hit and things really got weird. 

Liberals started pushing for even greater state control. Forced closures of businesses, executive orders, vaccine mandates, clamping down on constitutional rights. 

And they also started cheering US military action abroad in the Ukraine. Obama started this with his love for drone warfare. Now we see the left cheering the political prosecution of their political opponents. Grim.

Every time I‚Äôve confronted someone accusing me of this I ask for them to provide me with one single receipt and they can‚Äôt because they don‚Äôt exist. You want to get mad because I‚Äôve been on stream with people who have opinions you do or don‚Äôt like & I didn‚Äôt say anything? Well newsflash I rarely chime in to topics I have zero desire to discuss. Just because others have opinions doesn‚Äôt mean I agree with them simply because I‚Äôm in their presence. I think water tastes disgusting; I‚Äôm in fully aware that 99.9% of the population disagrees & that‚Äôs fine. Just because you‚Äôre in my presence doesn‚Äôt mean you automatically share my views(crazy how that works right).

Now another accusation is that I‚Äôm ‚Äúdefending Nick‚Äù because I called out Aaron.  Idk if it‚Äôs willing ignorance or you‚Äôre just not intelligent enough to understand that just because you‚Äôve deemed one person the ultimate villain does not disqualify other monsters in the situation. Before all this started I didn‚Äôt know who tf this guy was. What I saw was a total sleezeball capitalizing on a situation for personal gain at the expense of children. My entire timeline was full of this jackass stirring the pot with disgusting sex stories that had nothing to actually do with the case but were just his ‚Äúinside scoop‚Äù for his 15minutes of fame. It absolutely disgusted me that someone could say the things he did stream after stream with a gigantic smile on his face. He knew those kids & claimed to care but was just a POS that didn‚Äôt do anything & yet still instead of helping them only continued to make their lives worse. They‚Äôre from a small town & this is a huge scandal. They‚Äôre already being judged by everyone around them & anyone including them can look up their last name & find any of the streams/clips of that jackass talking shit about their parents. Now if you still don‚Äôt understand why I would choose to call that shit out idk what to tell you this is something even Forest Gump would understand. 

Lastly all this situation has done has open my eyes to the amount of cancel culture pigs on my timeline. Every single one of you that accused me shit because I kept my opinions to myself are no better than the wackos that went after Gina or anyone else that steps out of line & doesn‚Äôt conform to your ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù. I‚Äôve seen your tweets & know who you are. All of you with the ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not with me then you‚Äôre my enemy‚Äù narrative should really take a step back and think about what you‚Äôre doing because It‚Äôs not good. Maybe take a minute & apply some common sense before demonizing me of ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù I didn‚Äôt commit or making accusations against me because I didn‚Äôt ‚Äústep in line‚Äù in the what you considered is a timely manner. Canceling me over your imaginary opinions won‚Äôt end well & forcing me to bend the knee to your will is only going to end in disappointment for you. I don‚Äôt put up with that kind of bs & I never will. 

At the end of the day my opinion on this really doesn‚Äôt matter nor will it change a single thing. Those kids have seen enough & me adding to it ultimately will not help.

"Glad to see Quaden is doing well after everything the poor kid endured from bullies...at school & online!

More context:
Quaden Bayles, an Australian indigenous boy, became the focus of a viral video in 2020. Quaden was born with achondroplasia, a form of dwarfism. 

The video, which gained global attention, was filmed by his mother, Yarraka Bayles, on February 19, 2020. It shows Quaden in a highly distressed state, crying uncontrollably in the back of a car after a day at school where he was bullied. 

The emotional intensity of the video is evident as Quaden expresses a desire to harm himself, saying, ‚ÄúI wish I could stab myself in the heart‚Äù and ‚ÄúGive me a knife, I want to k*ll myself‚Äù‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã.

Every time I‚Äôve confronted someone accusing me of this I ask for them to provide me with one single receipt and they can‚Äôt because they don‚Äôt exist. You want to get mad because I‚Äôve been on stream with people who have opinions you do or don‚Äôt like & I didn‚Äôt say anything? Well newsflash I rarely chime in to topics I have zero desire to discuss. Just because others have opinions doesn‚Äôt mean I agree with them simply because I‚Äôm in their presence. I think water tastes disgusting; I‚Äôm in fully aware that 99.9% of the population disagrees & that‚Äôs fine. Just because you‚Äôre in my presence doesn‚Äôt mean you automatically share my views(crazy how that works right).

Now another accusation is that I‚Äôm ‚Äúdefending Nick‚Äù because I called out Aaron.  Idk if it‚Äôs willing ignorance or you‚Äôre just not intelligent enough to understand that just because you‚Äôve deemed one person the ultimate villain does not disqualify other monsters in the situation. Before all this started I didn‚Äôt know who tf this guy was. What I saw was a total sleezeball capitalizing on a situation for personal gain at the expense of children. My entire timeline was full of this jackass stirring the pot with disgusting sex stories that had nothing to actually do with the case but were just his ‚Äúinside scoop‚Äù for his 15minutes of fame. It absolutely disgusted me that someone could say the things he did stream after stream with a gigantic smile on his face. He knew those kids & claimed to care but was just a POS that didn‚Äôt do anything & yet still instead of helping them only continued to make their lives worse. They‚Äôre from a small town & this is a huge scandal. They‚Äôre already being judged by everyone around them & anyone including them can look up their last name & find any of the streams/clips of that jackass talking shit about their parents. Now if you still don‚Äôt understand why I would choose to call that shit out idk what to tell you this is something even Forest Gump would understand. 

Lastly all this situation has done has open my eyes to the amount of cancel culture pigs on my timeline. Every single one of you that accused me shit because I kept my opinions to myself are no better than the wackos that went after Gina or anyone else that steps out of line & doesn‚Äôt conform to your ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù. I‚Äôve seen your tweets & know who you are. All of you with the ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not with me then you‚Äôre my enemy‚Äù narrative should really take a step back and think about what you‚Äôre doing because It‚Äôs not good. Maybe take a minute & apply some common sense before demonizing me of ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù I didn‚Äôt commit or making accusations against me because I didn‚Äôt ‚Äústep in line‚Äù in the what you considered is a timely manner. Canceling me over your imaginary opinions won‚Äôt end well & forcing me to bend the knee to your will is only going to end in disappointment for you. I don‚Äôt put up with that kind of bs & I never will. 

At the end of the day my opinion on this really doesn‚Äôt matter nor will it change a single thing. Those kids have seen enough & me adding to it ultimately will not help.

I think I‚Äôve figured out why I‚Äôm so turned off with the current left: they have become the establishment. 

Growing up the Republican Party, with its oppressive brand of moral conservatism, felt like the owners of the ‚Äúestablishment.‚Äù

The hippies and the left were a reaction to that. Free love, rock and roll, anti-war, anti-establishment.  That was followed by punk rock culture ‚Äî liberals continued to be the standard bearers of the antiestablishment. 

Even into the 90s/2000s, you had anti-war liberals pushing back against the Falwell moral majority and protesting the Iraq war (that was me üëã).  Then the pushback to the disastrous neocon political movement of the post-9/11 2000s. 

Then it all started to change. Trump in 2016 flipped everything on its head. Suddenly republicans were much less hawkish, ignoring foreign wars. and the liberals lost their mind with TDS. So everything then became a reaction to trump. 

Then covid hit and things really got weird. 

Liberals started pushing for even greater state control. Forced closures of businesses, executive orders, vaccine mandates, clamping down on constitutional rights. 

And they also started cheering US military action abroad in the Ukraine. Obama started this with his love for drone warfare. Now we see the left cheering the political prosecution of their political opponents. Grim. 

So now, all the sudden, the anti-establishment left of the last 60 years has swung hard to become the people they‚Äôve fought against. 

And there‚Äôs nothing less punk rock than fighting for the establishment.",32,386,bullying detected

"10. Club Friday Season 16: Love Bully (2024)

Episodes: 4
Airs: Jun 7, 2024 - Jun 28, 2024
Airs On: Friday
Original Network: One 31

Main Cast: Charlotte Austin , Engfa Waraha

Plot
In the era of social media, everyone can freely express their opinions about others. They can use harsh words without much consideration, not thinking about the consequences or verifying the truth.

In a relationship between two women, one becomes overly concerned with the opinions of others, making her vulnerable to someone she doesn't know who ends up hurting her. The second woman has never cared much, firmly believing in the adage ""to each their own."" However, at times, she can be remarkably oblivious to the feelings of those around her.

With their love in the spotlight, eyes across the nation scrutinise their every move, passing judgement on ever action.

To r*pe women while slicing their breasts off and play football with body parts. But sure, the most important is to be kind to a person who wants all this to continue.

Ruth Perez with her father Eric were brutally m*rdered by Hamas at music festival. Ruth couldn't walk or talk but music was her life. What kind of monsters don't have mercy for such an innocent disabled girl?

Kapshiter family - parents Dina and Evgeny, and children Alin and Ethan were brutally m*rdered by Hamas monsters, when trying to escape. Hamas savages saw that it is a family with kids in the car, why did they sla*ghter them?? Ethan was a kid with special needs. Alin's body was found in another location weeks after her parents and brother's bodies were found. What did the horrific monsters do to her before m*rdering?

Noya Dan, 13 years old, was autistic girl. Hamas savages dragged her and her grandmother to Gaza border, m*rdered them and dumped their bodies in the dirt.

I have many more examples.
I am thinking about all of them every day.
I can't stop writing about them.
I can't sleep at night.

And white rich supremacist Biden doesn't care. He wants Hamas to win, to recover, to continue. Me, my family, my friends, kids I work with - we all will be the next victims. 

I was quiet about Biden for 8 months, hoping that maybe he cares, a bit. But no. He doesn't. 

But sure, go on, accuse me of being not sensitive. Go on.",167,475,bullying detected

I have since decided I am not obliged to be anybody‚Äôs punching bag. And I now advise anyone else who ends up in a similar situation the same.

"Long post warning üö® 

I think I‚Äôve figured out why I‚Äôm so turned off with the current left: they have become the establishment. 

Growing up the Republican Party, with its oppressive brand of moral conservatism, felt like the owners of the ‚Äúestablishment.‚Äù

The hippies and the left were a reaction to that. Free love, rock and roll, anti-war, anti-establishment.  That was followed by punk rock culture ‚Äî liberals continued to be the standard bearers of the antiestablishment. 

Even into the 90s/2000s, you had anti-war liberals pushing back against the Falwell moral majority and protesting the Iraq war (that was me üëã).  Then the pushback to the disastrous neocon political movement of the post-9/11 2000s. 

Then it all started to change. Trump in 2016 flipped everything on its head. Suddenly republicans were much less hawkish, ignoring foreign wars. and the liberals lost their mind with TDS. So everything then became a reaction to trump. 

Then covid hit and things really got weird. 

Liberals started pushing for even greater state control. Forced closures of businesses, executive orders, vaccine mandates, clamping down on constitutional rights. 

And they also started cheering US military action abroad in the Ukraine. Obama started this with his love for drone warfare. Now we see the left cheering the political prosecution of their political opponents. Grim. 

So now, all the sudden, the anti-establishment left of the last 60 years has swung hard to become the people they‚Äôve fought against.

Episodes: 4
Airs: Jun 7, 2024 - Jun 28, 2024
Airs On: Friday
Original Network: One 31

Main Cast: Charlotte Austin , Engfa Waraha

Plot
In the era of social media, everyone can freely express their opinions about others. They can use harsh words without much consideration, not thinking about the consequences or verifying the truth.

In a relationship between two women, one becomes overly concerned with the opinions of others, making her vulnerable to someone she doesn't know who ends up hurting her. The second woman has never cared much, firmly believing in the adage ""to each their own."" However, at times, she can be remarkably oblivious to the feelings of those around her.

With their love in the spotlight, eyes across the nation scrutinise their every move, passing judgement on ever action.

This false narrative has been repeated in my mentions for days all because I‚Äôm guilty of not immediately giving my opinion & condemning Nick. Every time I‚Äôve confronted someone accusing me of this I ask for them to provide me with one single receipt and they can‚Äôt because they don‚Äôt exist. You want to get mad because I‚Äôve been on stream with people who have opinions you do or don‚Äôt like & I didn‚Äôt say anything? Well newsflash I rarely chime in to topics I have zero desire to discuss. Just because others have opinions doesn‚Äôt mean I agree with them simply because I‚Äôm in their presence. I think water tastes disgusting; I‚Äôm in fully aware that 99.9% of the population disagrees & that‚Äôs fine. Just because you‚Äôre in my presence doesn‚Äôt mean you automatically share my views(crazy how that works right).

Now another accusation is that I‚Äôm ‚Äúdefending Nick‚Äù because I called out Aaron.  Idk if it‚Äôs willing ignorance or you‚Äôre just not intelligent enough to understand that just because you‚Äôve deemed one person the ultimate villain does not disqualify other monsters in the situation. Before all this started I didn‚Äôt know who tf this guy was. What I saw was a total sleezeball capitalizing on a situation for personal gain at the expense of children. My entire timeline was full of this jackass stirring the pot with disgusting sex stories that had nothing to actually do with the case but were just his ‚Äúinside scoop‚Äù for his 15minutes of fame. It absolutely disgusted me that someone could say the things he did stream after stream with a gigantic smile on his face. He knew those kids & claimed to care but was just a POS that didn‚Äôt do anything & yet still instead of helping them only continued to make their lives worse. They‚Äôre from a small town & this is a huge scandal. They‚Äôre already being judged by everyone around them & anyone including them can look up their last name & find any of the streams/clips of that jackass talking shit about their parents. Now if you still don‚Äôt understand why I would choose to call that shit out idk what to tell you this is something even Forest Gump would understand. 

Lastly all this situation has done has open my eyes to the amount of cancel culture pigs on my timeline. Every single one of you that accused me shit because I kept my opinions to myself are no better than the wackos that went after Gina or anyone else that steps out of line & doesn‚Äôt conform to your ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù. I‚Äôve seen your tweets & know who you are. All of you with the ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not with me then you‚Äôre my enemy‚Äù narrative should really take a step back and think about what you‚Äôre doing because It‚Äôs not good. Maybe take a minute & apply some common sense before demonizing me of ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù I didn‚Äôt commit or making accusations against me because I didn‚Äôt ‚Äústep in line‚Äù in the what you considered is a timely manner. Canceling me over your imaginary opinions won‚Äôt end well & forcing me to bend the knee to your will is only going to end in disappointment for you. I don‚Äôt put up with that kind of bs & I never will. 

At the end of the day my opinion on this really doesn‚Äôt matter nor will it change a single thing. Those kids have seen enough & me adding to it ultimately will not help. Everyone that actually knows me knows where I stand on this including Nick. Going after me with pitchforks because you want blood isn‚Äôt going to solve anything.

If you lie about them or smear them don‚Äôt be surprised if they block you. If you like tweets doing these things don‚Äôt be surprised if they block you. 

Nobody is obliged to be anybody else‚Äôs punching bag and they have every right to protect themselves as they see fit in order to be able to carry on their work and lives without absorbing whatever spite or rage you think you should be able to chuck at them.

Every time I‚Äôve confronted someone accusing me of this I ask for them to provide me with one single receipt and they can‚Äôt because they don‚Äôt exist. You want to get mad because I‚Äôve been on stream with people who have opinions you do or don‚Äôt like & I didn‚Äôt say anything? Well newsflash I rarely chime in to topics I have zero desire to discuss. Just because others have opinions doesn‚Äôt mean I agree with them simply because I‚Äôm in their presence. I think water tastes disgusting; I‚Äôm in fully aware that 99.9% of the population disagrees & that‚Äôs fine. Just because you‚Äôre in my presence doesn‚Äôt mean you automatically share my views(crazy how that works right).

Now another accusation is that I‚Äôm ‚Äúdefending Nick‚Äù because I called out Aaron.  Idk if it‚Äôs willing ignorance or you‚Äôre just not intelligent enough to understand that just because you‚Äôve deemed one person the ultimate villain does not disqualify other monsters in the situation. Before all this started I didn‚Äôt know who tf this guy was. What I saw was a total sleezeball capitalizing on a situation for personal gain at the expense of children. My entire timeline was full of this jackass stirring the pot with disgusting sex stories that had nothing to actually do with the case but were just his ‚Äúinside scoop‚Äù for his 15minutes of fame. It absolutely disgusted me that someone could say the things he did stream after stream with a gigantic smile on his face. He knew those kids & claimed to care but was just a POS that didn‚Äôt do anything & yet still instead of helping them only continued to make their lives worse. They‚Äôre from a small town & this is a huge scandal. They‚Äôre already being judged by everyone around them & anyone including them can look up their last name & find any of the streams/clips of that jackass talking shit about their parents. Now if you still don‚Äôt understand why I would choose to call that shit out idk what to tell you this is something even Forest Gump would understand. 

Lastly all this situation has done has open my eyes to the amount of cancel culture pigs on my timeline. Every single one of you that accused me shit because I kept my opinions to myself are no better than the wackos that went after Gina or anyone else that steps out of line & doesn‚Äôt conform to your ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù. I‚Äôve seen your tweets & know who you are. All of you with the ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not with me then you‚Äôre my enemy‚Äù narrative should really take a step back and think about what you‚Äôre doing because It‚Äôs not good. Maybe take a minute & apply some common sense before demonizing me of ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù I didn‚Äôt commit or making accusations against me because I didn‚Äôt ‚Äústep in line‚Äù in the what you considered is a timely manner. Canceling me over your imaginary opinions won‚Äôt end well & forcing me to bend the knee to your will is only going to end in disappointment for you. I don‚Äôt put up with that kind of bs & I never will. 

At the end of the day my opinion on this really doesn‚Äôt matter nor will it change a single thing. Those kids have seen enough & me adding to it ultimately will not help. Everyone that actually knows me knows where I stand on this including Nick. Going after me with pitchforks because you want blood isn‚Äôt going to solve anything.

I think I‚Äôve figured out why I‚Äôm so turned off with the current left: they have become the establishment. 

Growing up the Republican Party, with its oppressive brand of moral conservatism, felt like the owners of the ‚Äúestablishment.‚Äù

The hippies and the left were a reaction to that. Free love, rock and roll, anti-war, anti-establishment.  That was followed by punk rock culture ‚Äî liberals continued to be the standard bearers of the antiestablishment. 

Even into the 90s/2000s, you had anti-war liberals pushing back against the Falwell moral majority and protesting the Iraq war (that was me üëã).  Then the pushback to the disastrous neocon political movement of the post-9/11 2000s. 

Then it all started to change. Trump in 2016 flipped everything on its head. Suddenly republicans were much less hawkish, ignoring foreign wars. and the liberals lost their mind with TDS. So everything then became a reaction to trump. 

Then covid hit and things really got weird. 

Liberals started pushing for even greater state control. Forced closures of businesses, executive orders, vaccine mandates, clamping down on constitutional rights. 

And they also started cheering US military action abroad in the Ukraine. Obama started this with his love for drone warfare. Now we see the left cheering the political prosecution of their political opponents. Grim. 

So now, all the sudden, the anti-establishment left of the last 60 years has swung hard to become the people they‚Äôve fought against.

Episodes: 4
Airs: Jun 7, 2024 - Jun 28, 2024
Airs On: Friday
Original Network: One 31

Main Cast: Charlotte Austin , Engfa Waraha

Plot
In the era of social media, everyone can freely express their opinions about others. They can use harsh words without much consideration, not thinking about the consequences or verifying the truth.

In a relationship between two women, one becomes overly concerned with the opinions of others, making her vulnerable to someone she doesn't know who ends up hurting her. The second woman has never cared much, firmly believing in the adage ""to each their own."" However, at times, she can be remarkably oblivious to the feelings of those around her.

With their love in the spotlight, eyes across the nation scrutinise their every move, passing judgement on ever action.

You want to get mad because I‚Äôve been on stream with people who have opinions you do or don‚Äôt like & I didn‚Äôt say anything? Well newsflash I rarely chime in to topics I have zero desire to discuss. Just because others have opinions doesn‚Äôt mean I agree with them simply because I‚Äôm in their presence. I think water tastes disgusting; I‚Äôm in fully aware that 99.9% of the population disagrees & that‚Äôs fine. Just because you‚Äôre in my presence doesn‚Äôt mean you automatically share my views(crazy how that works right).

Now another accusation is that I‚Äôm ‚Äúdefending Nick‚Äù because I called out Aaron.  Idk if it‚Äôs willing ignorance or you‚Äôre just not intelligent enough to understand that just because you‚Äôve deemed one person the ultimate villain does not disqualify other monsters in the situation.

They‚Äôre from a small town & this is a huge scandal. They‚Äôre already being judged by everyone around them & anyone including them can look up their last name & find any of the streams/clips of that jackass talking shit about their parents. Now if you still don‚Äôt understand why I would choose to call that shit out idk what to tell you this is something even Forest Gump would understand. 

Lastly all this situation has done has open my eyes to the amount of cancel culture pigs on my timeline. Every single one of you that accused me shit because I kept my opinions to myself are no better than the wackos that went after Gina or anyone else that steps out of line & doesn‚Äôt conform to your ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù. I‚Äôve seen your tweets & know who you are. All of you with the ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not with me then you‚Äôre my enemy‚Äù narrative should really take a step back and think about what you‚Äôre doing because It‚Äôs not good.

Canceling me over your imaginary opinions won‚Äôt end well & forcing me to bend the knee to your will is only going to end in disappointment for you. I don‚Äôt put up with that kind of bs & I never will. 

At the end of the day my opinion on this really doesn‚Äôt matter nor will it change a single thing. Those kids have seen enough & me adding to it ultimately will not help.

"Long post warning üö® 

I think I‚Äôve figured out why I‚Äôm so turned off with the current left: they have become the establishment. 

Growing up the Republican Party, with its oppressive brand of moral conservatism, felt like the owners of the ‚Äúestablishment.‚Äù

The hippies and the left were a reaction to that. Free love, rock and roll, anti-war, anti-establishment.  That was followed by punk rock culture ‚Äî liberals continued to be the standard bearers of the antiestablishment. 

Even into the 90s/2000s, you had anti-war liberals pushing back against the Falwell moral majority and protesting the Iraq war (that was me üëã).  Then the pushback to the disastrous neocon political movement of the post-9/11 2000s. 

Then it all started to change. Trump in 2016 flipped everything on its head. Suddenly republicans were much less hawkish, ignoring foreign wars. and the liberals lost their mind with TDS. So everything then became a reaction to trump. 

Then covid hit and things really got weird. 

Liberals started pushing for even greater state control. Forced closures of businesses, executive orders, vaccine mandates, clamping down on constitutional rights. 

And they also started cheering US military action abroad in the Ukraine. Obama started this with his love for drone warfare. Now we see the left cheering the political prosecution of their political opponents. Grim. 

So now, all the sudden, the anti-establishment left of the last 60 years has swung hard to become the people they‚Äôve fought against. 

And there‚Äôs nothing less punk rock than fighting for the establishment.",32,386,bullying detected

"10. Club Friday Season 16: Love Bully (2024)

Episodes: 4
Airs: Jun 7, 2024 - Jun 28, 2024
Airs On: Friday
Original Network: One 31

Main Cast: Charlotte Austin , Engfa Waraha

Plot
In the era of social media, everyone can freely express their opinions about others. They can use harsh words without much consideration, not thinking about the consequences or verifying the truth.

In a relationship between two women, one becomes overly concerned with the opinions of others, making her vulnerable to someone she doesn't know who ends up hurting her. The second woman has never cared much, firmly believing in the adage ""to each their own."" However, at times, she can be remarkably oblivious to the feelings of those around her.

With their love in the spotlight, eyes across the nation scrutinise their every move, passing judgement on ever action.

In the autumn of 2022 I ended up in an eight week pile on in which I spent a long time trying to reason with people who were not interested in any good faith engagement and whose behaviour towards me was at best hostile and at worst extremely abusive.

I have since decided I am not obliged to be anybody‚Äôs punching bag. And I now advise anyone else who ends up in a similar situation the same.

More context:
Quaden Bayles, an Australian indigenous boy, became the focus of a viral video in 2020. Quaden was born with achondroplasia, a form of dwarfism. 

The video, which gained global attention, was filmed by his mother, Yarraka Bayles, on February 19, 2020. It shows Quaden in a highly distressed state, crying uncontrollably in the back of a car after a day at school where he was bullied.

"#NarcissisticAbuse is a devastating form of emotional and psychological abuse caused by someone with high narcissistic traits. It involves a range of manipulative behaviors like gaslighting, blame-shifting, devaluation, and constant belittling and criticism that erodes your self-esteem. The abuser will try to control and isolates you, cutting you off from support and making you feel dependent and powerless. They may alternate between being nice and cruel, leaving you in a constant state of anxiety, desperately seeking their approval. The victim may look like they are lying or crazy when they try to explain what‚Äôs going on because the narcissist‚Äôs two-faced nature is shamelessly hidden behind a mask of charm, lies, manipulation and smear campaigns. This kind of abuse can lead to serious emotional damage, including anxiety, depression, a loss of self-worth, and in extreme cases, C-PTSD, self medication, or suicide. It could be described as covert psychological violence.",294,649,bullying detected

"Long post warning üö® 

I think I‚Äôve figured out why I‚Äôm so turned off with the current left: they have become the establishment. 

Growing up the Republican Party, with its oppressive brand of moral conservatism, felt like the owners of the ‚Äúestablishment.‚Äù

The hippies and the left were a reaction to that. Free love, rock and roll, anti-war, anti-establishment.  That was followed by punk rock culture ‚Äî liberals continued to be the standard bearers of the antiestablishment. 

Even into the 90s/2000s, you had anti-war liberals pushing back against the Falwell moral majority and protesting the Iraq war (that was me üëã).  Then the pushback to the disastrous neocon political movement of the post-9/11 2000s. 

Then it all started to change. Trump in 2016 flipped everything on its head. Suddenly republicans were much less hawkish, ignoring foreign wars. and the liberals lost their mind with TDS. So everything then became a reaction to trump. 

Then covid hit and things really got weird. 

Liberals started pushing for even greater state control. Forced closures of businesses, executive orders, vaccine mandates, clamping down on constitutional rights. 

And they also started cheering US military action abroad in the Ukraine. Obama started this with his love for drone warfare. Now we see the left cheering the political prosecution of their political opponents. Grim. 

So now, all the sudden, the anti-establishment left of the last 60 years has swung hard to become the people they‚Äôve fought against. 

And there‚Äôs nothing less punk rock than fighting for the establishment.",32,386,bullying detected

"10. Club Friday Season 16: Love Bully (2024)

Episodes: 4
Airs: Jun 7, 2024 - Jun 28, 2024
Airs On: Friday
Original Network: One 31

Main Cast: Charlotte Austin , Engfa Waraha

Plot
In the era of social media, everyone can freely express their opinions about others. They can use harsh words without much consideration, not thinking about the consequences or verifying the truth.

In a relationship between two women, one becomes overly concerned with the opinions of others, making her vulnerable to someone she doesn't know who ends up hurting her. The second woman has never cared much, firmly believing in the adage ""to each their own."" However, at times, she can be remarkably oblivious to the feelings of those around her.

With their love in the spotlight, eyes across the nation scrutinise their every move, passing judgement on ever action.

It involves a range of manipulative behaviors like gaslighting, blame-shifting, devaluation, and constant belittling and criticism that erodes your self-esteem.

They may alternate between being nice and cruel, leaving you in a constant state of anxiety, desperately seeking their approval. The victim may look like they are lying or crazy when they try to explain what‚Äôs going on because the narcissist‚Äôs two-faced nature is shamelessly hidden behind a mask of charm, lies, manipulation and smear campaigns.

In the autumn of 2022 I ended up in an eight week pile on in which I spent a long time trying to reason with people who were not interested in any good faith engagement and whose behaviour towards me was at best hostile and at worst extremely abusive.

I have since decided I am not obliged to be anybody‚Äôs punching bag. And I now advise anyone else who ends up in a similar situation the same.

"Long post warning üö® 

I think I‚Äôve figured out why I‚Äôm so turned off with the current left: they have become the establishment. 

Growing up the Republican Party, with its oppressive brand of moral conservatism, felt like the owners of the ‚Äúestablishment.‚Äù

The hippies and the left were a reaction to that. Free love, rock and roll, anti-war, anti-establishment.  That was followed by punk rock culture ‚Äî liberals continued to be the standard bearers of the antiestablishment. 

Even into the 90s/2000s, you had anti-war liberals pushing back against the Falwell moral majority and protesting the Iraq war (that was me üëã).  Then the pushback to the disastrous neocon political movement of the post-9/11 2000s. 

Then it all started to change. Trump in 2016 flipped everything on its head. Suddenly republicans were much less hawkish, ignoring foreign wars. and the liberals lost their mind with TDS. So everything then became a reaction to trump. 

Then covid hit and things really got weird. 

Liberals started pushing for even greater state control. Forced closures of businesses, executive orders, vaccine mandates, clamping down on constitutional rights. 

And they also started cheering US military action abroad in the Ukraine. Obama started this with his love for drone warfare. Now we see the left cheering the political prosecution of their political opponents. Grim. 

So now, all the sudden, the anti-establishment left of the last 60 years has swung hard to become the people they‚Äôve fought against.

Episodes: 4
Airs: Jun 7, 2024 - Jun 28, 2024
Airs On: Friday
Original Network: One 31

Main Cast: Charlotte Austin , Engfa Waraha

Plot
In the era of social media, everyone can freely express their opinions about others. They can use harsh words without much consideration, not thinking about the consequences or verifying the truth.

In a relationship between two women, one becomes overly concerned with the opinions of others, making her vulnerable to someone she doesn't know who ends up hurting her. The second woman has never cared much, firmly believing in the adage ""to each their own."" However, at times, she can be remarkably oblivious to the feelings of those around her.

With their love in the spotlight, eyes across the nation scrutinise their every move, passing judgement on ever action.

"Theres this false narrative going around that I ‚Äúdefended Nick‚Äù & am therefore ‚Äúpro child neglect/abuse including drugs & swinging‚Äù. This false narrative has been repeated in my mentions for days all because I‚Äôm guilty of not immediately giving my opinion & condemning Nick. Every time I‚Äôve confronted someone accusing me of this I ask for them to provide me with one single receipt and they can‚Äôt because they don‚Äôt exist. You want to get mad because I‚Äôve been on stream with people who have opinions you do or don‚Äôt like & I didn‚Äôt say anything? Well newsflash I rarely chime in to topics I have zero desire to discuss. Just because others have opinions doesn‚Äôt mean I agree with them simply because I‚Äôm in their presence. I think water tastes disgusting; I‚Äôm in fully aware that 99.9% of the population disagrees & that‚Äôs fine. Just because you‚Äôre in my presence doesn‚Äôt mean you automatically share my views(crazy how that works right).

Now another accusation is that I‚Äôm ‚Äúdefending Nick‚Äù because I called out Aaron.  Idk if it‚Äôs willing ignorance or you‚Äôre just not intelligent enough to understand that just because you‚Äôve deemed one person the ultimate villain does not disqualify other monsters in the situation. Before all this started I didn‚Äôt know who tf this guy was. What I saw was a total sleezeball capitalizing on a situation for personal gain at the expense of children. My entire timeline was full of this jackass stirring the pot with disgusting sex stories that had nothing to actually do with the case but were just his ‚Äúinside scoop‚Äù for his 15minutes of fame. It absolutely disgusted me that someone could say the things he did stream after stream with a gigantic smile on his face. He knew those kids & claimed to care but was just a POS that didn‚Äôt do anything & yet still instead of helping them only continued to make their lives worse. They‚Äôre from a small town & this is a huge scandal. They‚Äôre already being judged by everyone around them & anyone including them can look up their last name & find any of the streams/clips of that jackass talking shit about their parents. Now if you still don‚Äôt understand why I would choose to call that shit out idk what to tell you this is something even Forest Gump would understand. 

Lastly all this situation has done has open my eyes to the amount of cancel culture pigs on my timeline. Every single one of you that accused me shit because I kept my opinions to myself are no better than the wackos that went after Gina or anyone else that steps out of line & doesn‚Äôt conform to your ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù. I‚Äôve seen your tweets & know who you are. All of you with the ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not with me then you‚Äôre my enemy‚Äù narrative should really take a step back and think about what you‚Äôre doing because It‚Äôs not good. Maybe take a minute & apply some common sense before demonizing me of ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù I didn‚Äôt commit or making accusations against me because I didn‚Äôt ‚Äústep in line‚Äù in the what you considered is a timely manner. Canceling me over your imaginary opinions won‚Äôt end well & forcing me to bend the knee to your will is only going to end in disappointment for you. I don‚Äôt put up with that kind of bs & I never will. 

At the end of the day my opinion on this really doesn‚Äôt matter nor will it change a single thing. Those kids have seen enough & me adding to it ultimately will not help. Everyone that actually knows me knows where I stand on this including Nick. Going after me with pitchforks because you want blood isn‚Äôt going to solve anything.

More context:
Quaden Bayles, an Australian indigenous boy, became the focus of a viral video in 2020. Quaden was born with achondroplasia, a form of dwarfism. 

The video, which gained global attention, was filmed by his mother, Yarraka Bayles, on February 19, 2020. It shows Quaden in a highly distressed state, crying uncontrollably in the back of a car after a day at school where he was bullied. 

The emotional intensity of the video is evident as Quaden expresses a desire to harm himself, saying, ‚ÄúI wish I could stab myself in the heart‚Äù and ‚ÄúGive me a knife, I want to k*ll myself‚Äù‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã.

"Theres this false narrative going around that I ‚Äúdefended Nick‚Äù & am therefore ‚Äúpro child neglect/abuse including drugs & swinging‚Äù. This false narrative has been repeated in my mentions for days all because I‚Äôm guilty of not immediately giving my opinion & condemning Nick. Every time I‚Äôve confronted someone accusing me of this I ask for them to provide me with one single receipt and they can‚Äôt because they don‚Äôt exist. You want to get mad because I‚Äôve been on stream with people who have opinions you do or don‚Äôt like & I didn‚Äôt say anything? Well newsflash I rarely chime in to topics I have zero desire to discuss. Just because others have opinions doesn‚Äôt mean I agree with them simply because I‚Äôm in their presence. I think water tastes disgusting; I‚Äôm in fully aware that 99.9% of the population disagrees & that‚Äôs fine. Just because you‚Äôre in my presence doesn‚Äôt mean you automatically share my views(crazy how that works right).

Now another accusation is that I‚Äôm ‚Äúdefending Nick‚Äù because I called out Aaron.  Idk if it‚Äôs willing ignorance or you‚Äôre just not intelligent enough to understand that just because you‚Äôve deemed one person the ultimate villain does not disqualify other monsters in the situation. Before all this started I didn‚Äôt know who tf this guy was. What I saw was a total sleezeball capitalizing on a situation for personal gain at the expense of children. My entire timeline was full of this jackass stirring the pot with disgusting sex stories that had nothing to actually do with the case but were just his ‚Äúinside scoop‚Äù for his 15minutes of fame. It absolutely disgusted me that someone could say the things he did stream after stream with a gigantic smile on his face. He knew those kids & claimed to care but was just a POS that didn‚Äôt do anything & yet still instead of helping them only continued to make their lives worse. They‚Äôre from a small town & this is a huge scandal. They‚Äôre already being judged by everyone around them & anyone including them can look up their last name & find any of the streams/clips of that jackass talking shit about their parents. Now if you still don‚Äôt understand why I would choose to call that shit out idk what to tell you this is something even Forest Gump would understand. 

Lastly all this situation has done has open my eyes to the amount of cancel culture pigs on my timeline. Every single one of you that accused me shit because I kept my opinions to myself are no better than the wackos that went after Gina or anyone else that steps out of line & doesn‚Äôt conform to your ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù. I‚Äôve seen your tweets & know who you are. All of you with the ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not with me then you‚Äôre my enemy‚Äù narrative should really take a step back and think about what you‚Äôre doing because It‚Äôs not good. Maybe take a minute & apply some common sense before demonizing me of ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù I didn‚Äôt commit or making accusations against me because I didn‚Äôt ‚Äústep in line‚Äù in the what you considered is a timely manner. Canceling me over your imaginary opinions won‚Äôt end well & forcing me to bend the knee to your will is only going to end in disappointment for you. I don‚Äôt put up with that kind of bs & I never will. 

At the end of the day my opinion on this really doesn‚Äôt matter nor will it change a single thing. Those kids have seen enough & me adding to it ultimately will not help. Everyone that actually knows me knows where I stand on this including Nick. Going after me with pitchforks because you want blood isn‚Äôt going to solve anything. It just exposes you cancel pigs for who you truly are.",47,743,bullying detected

"Long post warning üö® 

I think I‚Äôve figured out why I‚Äôm so turned off with the current left: they have become the establishment. 

Growing up the Republican Party, with its oppressive brand of moral conservatism, felt like the owners of the ‚Äúestablishment.‚Äù

The hippies and the left were a reaction to that. Free love, rock and roll, anti-war, anti-establishment.  That was followed by punk rock culture ‚Äî liberals continued to be the standard bearers of the antiestablishment. 

Even into the 90s/2000s, you had anti-war liberals pushing back against the Falwell moral majority and protesting the Iraq war (that was me üëã).  Then the pushback to the disastrous neocon political movement of the post-9/11 2000s. 

Then it all started to change. Trump in 2016 flipped everything on its head. Suddenly republicans were much less hawkish, ignoring foreign wars. and the liberals lost their mind with TDS. So everything then became a reaction to trump. 

Then covid hit and things really got weird. 

Liberals started pushing for even greater state control. Forced closures of businesses, executive orders, vaccine mandates, clamping down on constitutional rights. 

And they also started cheering US military action abroad in the Ukraine. Obama started this with his love for drone warfare. Now we see the left cheering the political prosecution of their political opponents. Grim.

In the era of social media, everyone can freely express their opinions about others. They can use harsh words without much consideration, not thinking about the consequences or verifying the truth.

In a relationship between two women, one becomes overly concerned with the opinions of others, making her vulnerable to someone she doesn't know who ends up hurting her. The second woman has never cared much, firmly believing in the adage ""to each their own."" However, at times, she can be remarkably oblivious to the feelings of those around her.

With their love in the spotlight, eyes across the nation scrutinise their every move, passing judgement on ever action.

"I received some hateful comments on my post about Biden. Apparently, I was cruel when I made remarks about his speech and said it made no sense. They say it's ""bullying"" - to write a post about most powerful man in the world, who is trying to save Hamas, so that they'd continue m*rdering, r*ping and kidnapping Israelis.

Isn't it displaced suicidal ""empathy"" that @GadSaad is always talking about?

Powerful white rich man is trying to save horrific monsters from hell, because of his own selfish interests, but I am supposed to be sensitive to his special needs? 

Hamas said that October 7 was great success and they want to continue doing it. To m*rder innocent Israelis, including babies, children, to burn people alive, to ashes, so that it took weeks to identify. To r*pe women while slicing their breasts off and play football with body parts. But sure, the most important is to be kind to a person who wants all this to continue.

Speaking of people with disabilities, many of them were m*rdered, sla*ghtered, r*ped and kidnapped by Hamas.

Ruth Perez with her father Eric were brutally m*rdered by Hamas at music festival. Ruth couldn't walk or talk but music was her life. What kind of monsters don't have mercy for such an innocent disabled girl?

Kapshiter family - parents Dina and Evgeny, and children Alin and Ethan were brutally m*rdered by Hamas monsters, when trying to escape. Hamas savages saw that it is a family with kids in the car, why did they sla*ghter them?? Ethan was a kid with special needs. Alin's body was found in another location weeks after her parents and brother's bodies were found. What did the horrific monsters do to her before m*rdering?

Noya Dan, 13 years old, was autistic girl. Hamas savages dragged her and her grandmother to Gaza border, m*rdered them and dumped their bodies in the dirt.

I have many more examples.
I am thinking about all of them every day.
I can't stop writing about them.
I can't sleep at night.

And white rich supremacist Biden doesn't care. He wants Hamas to win, to recover, to continue. Me, my family, my friends, kids I work with - we all will be the next victims. 

I was quiet about Biden for 8 months, hoping that maybe he cares, a bit. But no. He doesn't. 

But sure, go on, accuse me of being not sensitive. Go on.",168,478,bullying detected

"#NarcissisticAbuse is a devastating form of emotional and psychological abuse caused by someone with high narcissistic traits. It involves a range of manipulative behaviors like gaslighting, blame-shifting, devaluation, and constant belittling and criticism that erodes your self-esteem. The abuser will try to control and isolates you, cutting you off from support and making you feel dependent and powerless. They may alternate between being nice and cruel, leaving you in a constant state of anxiety, desperately seeking their approval. The victim may look like they are lying or crazy when they try to explain what‚Äôs going on because the narcissist‚Äôs two-faced nature is shamelessly hidden behind a mask of charm, lies, manipulation and smear campaigns. This kind of abuse can lead to serious emotional damage, including anxiety, depression, a loss of self-worth, and in extreme cases, C-PTSD, self medication, or suicide. It could be described as covert psychological violence.",296,655,bullying detected

Every time I‚Äôve confronted someone accusing me of this I ask for them to provide me with one single receipt and they can‚Äôt because they don‚Äôt exist. You want to get mad because I‚Äôve been on stream with people who have opinions you do or don‚Äôt like & I didn‚Äôt say anything? Well newsflash I rarely chime in to topics I have zero desire to discuss. Just because others have opinions doesn‚Äôt mean I agree with them simply because I‚Äôm in their presence. I think water tastes disgusting; I‚Äôm in fully aware that 99.9% of the population disagrees & that‚Äôs fine. Just because you‚Äôre in my presence doesn‚Äôt mean you automatically share my views(crazy how that works right).

Now another accusation is that I‚Äôm ‚Äúdefending Nick‚Äù because I called out Aaron.  Idk if it‚Äôs willing ignorance or you‚Äôre just not intelligent enough to understand that just because you‚Äôve deemed one person the ultimate villain does not disqualify other monsters in the situation. Before all this started I didn‚Äôt know who tf this guy was. What I saw was a total sleezeball capitalizing on a situation for personal gain at the expense of children. My entire timeline was full of this jackass stirring the pot with disgusting sex stories that had nothing to actually do with the case but were just his ‚Äúinside scoop‚Äù for his 15minutes of fame. It absolutely disgusted me that someone could say the things he did stream after stream with a gigantic smile on his face. He knew those kids & claimed to care but was just a POS that didn‚Äôt do anything & yet still instead of helping them only continued to make their lives worse. They‚Äôre from a small town & this is a huge scandal. They‚Äôre already being judged by everyone around them & anyone including them can look up their last name & find any of the streams/clips of that jackass talking shit about their parents. Now if you still don‚Äôt understand why I would choose to call that shit out idk what to tell you this is something even Forest Gump would understand. 

Lastly all this situation has done has open my eyes to the amount of cancel culture pigs on my timeline. Every single one of you that accused me shit because I kept my opinions to myself are no better than the wackos that went after Gina or anyone else that steps out of line & doesn‚Äôt conform to your ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù. I‚Äôve seen your tweets & know who you are. All of you with the ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not with me then you‚Äôre my enemy‚Äù narrative should really take a step back and think about what you‚Äôre doing because It‚Äôs not good. Maybe take a minute & apply some common sense before demonizing me of ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù I didn‚Äôt commit or making accusations against me because I didn‚Äôt ‚Äústep in line‚Äù in the what you considered is a timely manner. Canceling me over your imaginary opinions won‚Äôt end well & forcing me to bend the knee to your will is only going to end in disappointment for you. I don‚Äôt put up with that kind of bs & I never will. 

At the end of the day my opinion on this really doesn‚Äôt matter nor will it change a single thing. Those kids have seen enough & me adding to it ultimately will not help. Everyone that actually knows me knows where I stand on this including Nick. Going after me with pitchforks because you want blood isn‚Äôt going to solve anything.

"Long post warning üö® 

I think I‚Äôve figured out why I‚Äôm so turned off with the current left: they have become the establishment. 

Growing up the Republican Party, with its oppressive brand of moral conservatism, felt like the owners of the ‚Äúestablishment.‚Äù

The hippies and the left were a reaction to that. Free love, rock and roll, anti-war, anti-establishment.  That was followed by punk rock culture ‚Äî liberals continued to be the standard bearers of the antiestablishment. 

Even into the 90s/2000s, you had anti-war liberals pushing back against the Falwell moral majority and protesting the Iraq war (that was me üëã).  Then the pushback to the disastrous neocon political movement of the post-9/11 2000s. 

Then it all started to change. Trump in 2016 flipped everything on its head. Suddenly republicans were much less hawkish, ignoring foreign wars. and the liberals lost their mind with TDS. So everything then became a reaction to trump. 

Then covid hit and things really got weird. 

Liberals started pushing for even greater state control. Forced closures of businesses, executive orders, vaccine mandates, clamping down on constitutional rights. 

And they also started cheering US military action abroad in the Ukraine. Obama started this with his love for drone warfare. Now we see the left cheering the political prosecution of their political opponents. Grim. 

So now, all the sudden, the anti-establishment left of the last 60 years has swung hard to become the people they‚Äôve fought against.

Main Cast: Charlotte Austin , Engfa Waraha

Plot
In the era of social media, everyone can freely express their opinions about others. They can use harsh words without much consideration, not thinking about the consequences or verifying the truth.

In a relationship between two women, one becomes overly concerned with the opinions of others, making her vulnerable to someone she doesn't know who ends up hurting her. The second woman has never cared much, firmly believing in the adage ""to each their own."" However, at times, she can be remarkably oblivious to the feelings of those around her.

With their love in the spotlight, eyes across the nation scrutinise their every move, passing judgement on ever action.

In the autumn of 2022 I ended up in an eight week pile on in which I spent a long time trying to reason with people who were not interested in any good faith engagement and whose behaviour towards me was at best hostile and at worst extremely abusive.

More context:
Quaden Bayles, an Australian indigenous boy, became the focus of a viral video in 2020. Quaden was born with achondroplasia, a form of dwarfism. 

The video, which gained global attention, was filmed by his mother, Yarraka Bayles, on February 19, 2020. It shows Quaden in a highly distressed state, crying uncontrollably in the back of a car after a day at school where he was bullied. 

The emotional intensity of the video is evident as Quaden expresses a desire to harm himself, saying, ‚ÄúI wish I could stab myself in the heart‚Äù and ‚ÄúGive me a knife, I want to k*ll myself‚Äù‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã.

"#NarcissisticAbuse is a devastating form of emotional and psychological abuse caused by someone with high narcissistic traits. It involves a range of manipulative behaviors like gaslighting, blame-shifting, devaluation, and constant belittling and criticism that erodes your self-esteem. The abuser will try to control and isolates you, cutting you off from support and making you feel dependent and powerless. They may alternate between being nice and cruel, leaving you in a constant state of anxiety, desperately seeking their approval. The victim may look like they are lying or crazy when they try to explain what‚Äôs going on because the narcissist‚Äôs two-faced nature is shamelessly hidden behind a mask of charm, lies, manipulation and smear campaigns. This kind of abuse can lead to serious emotional damage, including anxiety, depression, a loss of self-worth, and in extreme cases, C-PTSD, self medication, or suicide. It could be described as covert psychological violence.",296,655,bullying detected

"Long post warning üö® 

I think I‚Äôve figured out why I‚Äôm so turned off with the current left: they have become the establishment. 

Growing up the Republican Party, with its oppressive brand of moral conservatism, felt like the owners of the ‚Äúestablishment.‚Äù

The hippies and the left were a reaction to that. Free love, rock and roll, anti-war, anti-establishment.  That was followed by punk rock culture ‚Äî liberals continued to be the standard bearers of the antiestablishment. 

Even into the 90s/2000s, you had anti-war liberals pushing back against the Falwell moral majority and protesting the Iraq war (that was me üëã).  Then the pushback to the disastrous neocon political movement of the post-9/11 2000s. 

Then it all started to change. Trump in 2016 flipped everything on its head. Suddenly republicans were much less hawkish, ignoring foreign wars. and the liberals lost their mind with TDS. So everything then became a reaction to trump. 

Then covid hit and things really got weird. 

Liberals started pushing for even greater state control. Forced closures of businesses, executive orders, vaccine mandates, clamping down on constitutional rights. 

And they also started cheering US military action abroad in the Ukraine. Obama started this with his love for drone warfare. Now we see the left cheering the political prosecution of their political opponents. Grim. 

So now, all the sudden, the anti-establishment left of the last 60 years has swung hard to become the people they‚Äôve fought against.

Episodes: 4
Airs: Jun 7, 2024 - Jun 28, 2024
Airs On: Friday
Original Network: One 31

Main Cast: Charlotte Austin , Engfa Waraha

Plot
In the era of social media, everyone can freely express their opinions about others. They can use harsh words without much consideration, not thinking about the consequences or verifying the truth.

In a relationship between two women, one becomes overly concerned with the opinions of others, making her vulnerable to someone she doesn't know who ends up hurting her. The second woman has never cared much, firmly believing in the adage ""to each their own."" However, at times, she can be remarkably oblivious to the feelings of those around her.

With their love in the spotlight, eyes across the nation scrutinise their every move, passing judgement on ever action.

"Theres this false narrative going around that I ‚Äúdefended Nick‚Äù & am therefore ‚Äúpro child neglect/abuse including drugs & swinging‚Äù. This false narrative has been repeated in my mentions for days all because I‚Äôm guilty of not immediately giving my opinion & condemning Nick. Every time I‚Äôve confronted someone accusing me of this I ask for them to provide me with one single receipt and they can‚Äôt because they don‚Äôt exist. You want to get mad because I‚Äôve been on stream with people who have opinions you do or don‚Äôt like & I didn‚Äôt say anything? Well newsflash I rarely chime in to topics I have zero desire to discuss. Just because others have opinions doesn‚Äôt mean I agree with them simply because I‚Äôm in their presence. I think water tastes disgusting; I‚Äôm in fully aware that 99.9% of the population disagrees & that‚Äôs fine. Just because you‚Äôre in my presence doesn‚Äôt mean you automatically share my views(crazy how that works right).

Now another accusation is that I‚Äôm ‚Äúdefending Nick‚Äù because I called out Aaron.  Idk if it‚Äôs willing ignorance or you‚Äôre just not intelligent enough to understand that just because you‚Äôve deemed one person the ultimate villain does not disqualify other monsters in the situation. Before all this started I didn‚Äôt know who tf this guy was. What I saw was a total sleezeball capitalizing on a situation for personal gain at the expense of children. My entire timeline was full of this jackass stirring the pot with disgusting sex stories that had nothing to actually do with the case but were just his ‚Äúinside scoop‚Äù for his 15minutes of fame. It absolutely disgusted me that someone could say the things he did stream after stream with a gigantic smile on his face. He knew those kids & claimed to care but was just a POS that didn‚Äôt do anything & yet still instead of helping them only continued to make their lives worse. They‚Äôre from a small town & this is a huge scandal. They‚Äôre already being judged by everyone around them & anyone including them can look up their last name & find any of the streams/clips of that jackass talking shit about their parents. Now if you still don‚Äôt understand why I would choose to call that shit out idk what to tell you this is something even Forest Gump would understand. 

Lastly all this situation has done has open my eyes to the amount of cancel culture pigs on my timeline. Every single one of you that accused me shit because I kept my opinions to myself are no better than the wackos that went after Gina or anyone else that steps out of line & doesn‚Äôt conform to your ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù. I‚Äôve seen your tweets & know who you are. All of you with the ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not with me then you‚Äôre my enemy‚Äù narrative should really take a step back and think about what you‚Äôre doing because It‚Äôs not good. Maybe take a minute & apply some common sense before demonizing me of ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù I didn‚Äôt commit or making accusations against me because I didn‚Äôt ‚Äústep in line‚Äù in the what you considered is a timely manner. Canceling me over your imaginary opinions won‚Äôt end well & forcing me to bend the knee to your will is only going to end in disappointment for you. I don‚Äôt put up with that kind of bs & I never will. 

At the end of the day my opinion on this really doesn‚Äôt matter nor will it change a single thing. Those kids have seen enough & me adding to it ultimately will not help. Everyone that actually knows me knows where I stand on this including Nick. Going after me with pitchforks because you want blood isn‚Äôt going to solve anything.

The video, which gained global attention, was filmed by his mother, Yarraka Bayles, on February 19, 2020. It shows Quaden in a highly distressed state, crying uncontrollably in the back of a car after a day at school where he was bullied.

"Theres this false narrative going around that I ‚Äúdefended Nick‚Äù & am therefore ‚Äúpro child neglect/abuse including drugs & swinging‚Äù. This false narrative has been repeated in my mentions for days all because I‚Äôm guilty of not immediately giving my opinion & condemning Nick. Every time I‚Äôve confronted someone accusing me of this I ask for them to provide me with one single receipt and they can‚Äôt because they don‚Äôt exist. You want to get mad because I‚Äôve been on stream with people who have opinions you do or don‚Äôt like & I didn‚Äôt say anything? Well newsflash I rarely chime in to topics I have zero desire to discuss. Just because others have opinions doesn‚Äôt mean I agree with them simply because I‚Äôm in their presence. I think water tastes disgusting; I‚Äôm in fully aware that 99.9% of the population disagrees & that‚Äôs fine. Just because you‚Äôre in my presence doesn‚Äôt mean you automatically share my views(crazy how that works right).

Now another accusation is that I‚Äôm ‚Äúdefending Nick‚Äù because I called out Aaron.  Idk if it‚Äôs willing ignorance or you‚Äôre just not intelligent enough to understand that just because you‚Äôve deemed one person the ultimate villain does not disqualify other monsters in the situation. Before all this started I didn‚Äôt know who tf this guy was. What I saw was a total sleezeball capitalizing on a situation for personal gain at the expense of children. My entire timeline was full of this jackass stirring the pot with disgusting sex stories that had nothing to actually do with the case but were just his ‚Äúinside scoop‚Äù for his 15minutes of fame. It absolutely disgusted me that someone could say the things he did stream after stream with a gigantic smile on his face. He knew those kids & claimed to care but was just a POS that didn‚Äôt do anything & yet still instead of helping them only continued to make their lives worse. They‚Äôre from a small town & this is a huge scandal. They‚Äôre already being judged by everyone around them & anyone including them can look up their last name & find any of the streams/clips of that jackass talking shit about their parents. Now if you still don‚Äôt understand why I would choose to call that shit out idk what to tell you this is something even Forest Gump would understand. 

Lastly all this situation has done has open my eyes to the amount of cancel culture pigs on my timeline. Every single one of you that accused me shit because I kept my opinions to myself are no better than the wackos that went after Gina or anyone else that steps out of line & doesn‚Äôt conform to your ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù. I‚Äôve seen your tweets & know who you are. All of you with the ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not with me then you‚Äôre my enemy‚Äù narrative should really take a step back and think about what you‚Äôre doing because It‚Äôs not good. Maybe take a minute & apply some common sense before demonizing me of ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù I didn‚Äôt commit or making accusations against me because I didn‚Äôt ‚Äústep in line‚Äù in the what you considered is a timely manner. Canceling me over your imaginary opinions won‚Äôt end well & forcing me to bend the knee to your will is only going to end in disappointment for you. I don‚Äôt put up with that kind of bs & I never will. 

At the end of the day my opinion on this really doesn‚Äôt matter nor will it change a single thing. Those kids have seen enough & me adding to it ultimately will not help. Everyone that actually knows me knows where I stand on this including Nick. Going after me with pitchforks because you want blood isn‚Äôt going to solve anything. It just exposes you cancel pigs for who you truly are.",47,747,bullying detected

I think I‚Äôve figured out why I‚Äôm so turned off with the current left: they have become the establishment. 

Growing up the Republican Party, with its oppressive brand of moral conservatism, felt like the owners of the ‚Äúestablishment.‚Äù

The hippies and the left were a reaction to that. Free love, rock and roll, anti-war, anti-establishment.  That was followed by punk rock culture ‚Äî liberals continued to be the standard bearers of the antiestablishment. 

Even into the 90s/2000s, you had anti-war liberals pushing back against the Falwell moral majority and protesting the Iraq war (that was me üëã).  Then the pushback to the disastrous neocon political movement of the post-9/11 2000s. 

Then it all started to change. Trump in 2016 flipped everything on its head. Suddenly republicans were much less hawkish, ignoring foreign wars. and the liberals lost their mind with TDS. So everything then became a reaction to trump. 

Then covid hit and things really got weird. 

Liberals started pushing for even greater state control. Forced closures of businesses, executive orders, vaccine mandates, clamping down on constitutional rights. 

And they also started cheering US military action abroad in the Ukraine. Obama started this with his love for drone warfare. Now we see the left cheering the political prosecution of their political opponents. Grim. 

So now, all the sudden, the anti-establishment left of the last 60 years has swung hard to become the people they‚Äôve fought against.

Episodes: 4
Airs: Jun 7, 2024 - Jun 28, 2024
Airs On: Friday
Original Network: One 31

Main Cast: Charlotte Austin , Engfa Waraha

Plot
In the era of social media, everyone can freely express their opinions about others. They can use harsh words without much consideration, not thinking about the consequences or verifying the truth.

In a relationship between two women, one becomes overly concerned with the opinions of others, making her vulnerable to someone she doesn't know who ends up hurting her. The second woman has never cared much, firmly believing in the adage ""to each their own."" However, at times, she can be remarkably oblivious to the feelings of those around her.

With their love in the spotlight, eyes across the nation scrutinise their every move, passing judgement on ever action.

"So just to be clear. In the autumn of 2022 I ended up in an eight week pile on in which I spent a long time trying to reason with people who were not interested in any good faith engagement and whose behaviour towards me was at best hostile and at worst extremely abusive.

I have since decided I am not obliged to be anybody‚Äôs punching bag. And I now advise anyone else who ends up in a similar situation the same.

"Theres this false narrative going around that I ‚Äúdefended Nick‚Äù & am therefore ‚Äúpro child neglect/abuse including drugs & swinging‚Äù. This false narrative has been repeated in my mentions for days all because I‚Äôm guilty of not immediately giving my opinion & condemning Nick. Every time I‚Äôve confronted someone accusing me of this I ask for them to provide me with one single receipt and they can‚Äôt because they don‚Äôt exist. You want to get mad because I‚Äôve been on stream with people who have opinions you do or don‚Äôt like & I didn‚Äôt say anything? Well newsflash I rarely chime in to topics I have zero desire to discuss. Just because others have opinions doesn‚Äôt mean I agree with them simply because I‚Äôm in their presence. I think water tastes disgusting; I‚Äôm in fully aware that 99.9% of the population disagrees & that‚Äôs fine. Just because you‚Äôre in my presence doesn‚Äôt mean you automatically share my views(crazy how that works right).

Now another accusation is that I‚Äôm ‚Äúdefending Nick‚Äù because I called out Aaron.  Idk if it‚Äôs willing ignorance or you‚Äôre just not intelligent enough to understand that just because you‚Äôve deemed one person the ultimate villain does not disqualify other monsters in the situation. Before all this started I didn‚Äôt know who tf this guy was. What I saw was a total sleezeball capitalizing on a situation for personal gain at the expense of children. My entire timeline was full of this jackass stirring the pot with disgusting sex stories that had nothing to actually do with the case but were just his ‚Äúinside scoop‚Äù for his 15minutes of fame. It absolutely disgusted me that someone could say the things he did stream after stream with a gigantic smile on his face. He knew those kids & claimed to care but was just a POS that didn‚Äôt do anything & yet still instead of helping them only continued to make their lives worse. They‚Äôre from a small town & this is a huge scandal. They‚Äôre already being judged by everyone around them & anyone including them can look up their last name & find any of the streams/clips of that jackass talking shit about their parents. Now if you still don‚Äôt understand why I would choose to call that shit out idk what to tell you this is something even Forest Gump would understand. 

Lastly all this situation has done has open my eyes to the amount of cancel culture pigs on my timeline. Every single one of you that accused me shit because I kept my opinions to myself are no better than the wackos that went after Gina or anyone else that steps out of line & doesn‚Äôt conform to your ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù. I‚Äôve seen your tweets & know who you are. All of you with the ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not with me then you‚Äôre my enemy‚Äù narrative should really take a step back and think about what you‚Äôre doing because It‚Äôs not good. Maybe take a minute & apply some common sense before demonizing me of ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù I didn‚Äôt commit or making accusations against me because I didn‚Äôt ‚Äústep in line‚Äù in the what you considered is a timely manner. Canceling me over your imaginary opinions won‚Äôt end well & forcing me to bend the knee to your will is only going to end in disappointment for you. I don‚Äôt put up with that kind of bs & I never will. 

At the end of the day my opinion on this really doesn‚Äôt matter nor will it change a single thing. Those kids have seen enough & me adding to it ultimately will not help. Everyone that actually knows me knows where I stand on this including Nick. Going after me with pitchforks because you want blood isn‚Äôt going to solve anything.

I think I‚Äôve figured out why I‚Äôm so turned off with the current left: they have become the establishment. 

Growing up the Republican Party, with its oppressive brand of moral conservatism, felt like the owners of the ‚Äúestablishment.‚Äù

The hippies and the left were a reaction to that. Free love, rock and roll, anti-war, anti-establishment.  That was followed by punk rock culture ‚Äî liberals continued to be the standard bearers of the antiestablishment. 

Even into the 90s/2000s, you had anti-war liberals pushing back against the Falwell moral majority and protesting the Iraq war (that was me üëã).  Then the pushback to the disastrous neocon political movement of the post-9/11 2000s. 

Then it all started to change. Trump in 2016 flipped everything on its head. Suddenly republicans were much less hawkish, ignoring foreign wars. and the liberals lost their mind with TDS. So everything then became a reaction to trump. 

Then covid hit and things really got weird. 

Liberals started pushing for even greater state control. Forced closures of businesses, executive orders, vaccine mandates, clamping down on constitutional rights. 

And they also started cheering US military action abroad in the Ukraine. Obama started this with his love for drone warfare. Now we see the left cheering the political prosecution of their political opponents. Grim. 

So now, all the sudden, the anti-establishment left of the last 60 years has swung hard to become the people they‚Äôve fought against.

Episodes: 4
Airs: Jun 7, 2024 - Jun 28, 2024
Airs On: Friday
Original Network: One 31

Main Cast: Charlotte Austin , Engfa Waraha

Plot
In the era of social media, everyone can freely express their opinions about others. They can use harsh words without much consideration, not thinking about the consequences or verifying the truth.

In a relationship between two women, one becomes overly concerned with the opinions of others, making her vulnerable to someone she doesn't know who ends up hurting her. The second woman has never cared much, firmly believing in the adage ""to each their own."" However, at times, she can be remarkably oblivious to the feelings of those around her.

With their love in the spotlight, eyes across the nation scrutinise their every move, passing judgement on ever action.

They say it's ""bullying"" - to write a post about most powerful man in the world, who is trying to save Hamas, so that they'd continue m*rdering, r*ping and kidnapping Israelis.

Isn't it displaced suicidal ""empathy"" that @GadSaad is always talking about?

Powerful white rich man is trying to save horrific monsters from hell, because of his own selfish interests, but I am supposed to be sensitive to his special needs? 

Hamas said that October 7 was great success and they want to continue doing it. To m*rder innocent Israelis, including babies, children, to burn people alive, to ashes, so that it took weeks to identify. To r*pe women while slicing their breasts off and play football with body parts. But sure, the most important is to be kind to a person who wants all this to continue.

Speaking of people with disabilities, many of them were m*rdered, sla*ghtered, r*ped and kidnapped by Hamas.

Ruth Perez with her father Eric were brutally m*rdered by Hamas at music festival. Ruth couldn't walk or talk but music was her life. What kind of monsters don't have mercy for such an innocent disabled girl?

Kapshiter family - parents Dina and Evgeny, and children Alin and Ethan were brutally m*rdered by Hamas monsters, when trying to escape. Hamas savages saw that it is a family with kids in the car, why did they sla*ghter them?? Ethan was a kid with special needs. Alin's body was found in another location weeks after her parents and brother's bodies were found. What did the horrific monsters do to her before m*rdering?

Noya Dan, 13 years old, was autistic girl. Hamas savages dragged her and her grandmother to Gaza border, m*rdered them and dumped their bodies in the dirt.

I have many more examples.
I am thinking about all of them every day.
I can't stop writing about them.
I can't sleep at night.

And white rich supremacist Biden doesn't care. He wants Hamas to win, to recover, to continue. Me, my family, my friends, kids I work with - we all will be the next victims.

"Long post warning üö® 

I think I‚Äôve figured out why I‚Äôm so turned off with the current left: they have become the establishment. 

Growing up the Republican Party, with its oppressive brand of moral conservatism, felt like the owners of the ‚Äúestablishment.‚Äù

The hippies and the left were a reaction to that. Free love, rock and roll, anti-war, anti-establishment.  That was followed by punk rock culture ‚Äî liberals continued to be the standard bearers of the antiestablishment. 

Even into the 90s/2000s, you had anti-war liberals pushing back against the Falwell moral majority and protesting the Iraq war (that was me üëã).  Then the pushback to the disastrous neocon political movement of the post-9/11 2000s. 

Then it all started to change. Trump in 2016 flipped everything on its head. Suddenly republicans were much less hawkish, ignoring foreign wars. and the liberals lost their mind with TDS. So everything then became a reaction to trump. 

Then covid hit and things really got weird. 

Liberals started pushing for even greater state control. Forced closures of businesses, executive orders, vaccine mandates, clamping down on constitutional rights. 

And they also started cheering US military action abroad in the Ukraine. Obama started this with his love for drone warfare. Now we see the left cheering the political prosecution of their political opponents. Grim. 

So now, all the sudden, the anti-establishment left of the last 60 years has swung hard to become the people they‚Äôve fought against.

"High Court and Court of Appeal Ruling Ignored as Senior DCI Officers Harass Landowner 

In 2010, Bharat Ramji, Harish Ramji, and Ashvin Ramji purchased a parcel of land from the National Social Security Fund (NSSF).

This prime real estate situated along Mombasa Road Next to the Mombasa Cement factory was a major investment but what began as a promising acquisition soon spiraled into a bitter legal battle marked by fraud, goon invasion, and allegations of corruption within our law enforcement system.

The Ramji family's ordeal started innocuously enough.

They acquired the land legally, receiving the title deed from NSSF.

But as fate would have it, Mombasa Cement Limited, a powerful entity with deep connections, had its sights set on the same land.

In a brazen move, Mombasa Cement deposited money into the NSSF account without any formal agreement or authorization, following which they orchestrated an illegal eviction of the Ramjis using hired goons who not only evicted them but also demolished parts of the boundary wall to amalgamate the property with their own factory premises.

The Ramjis, now dispossessed of their land, sought justice in the High Court at Milimani.

Justice Kossy Bor presided over the case, which seemed straightforward enough given the clear legal ownership documents the Ramjis held but in a surprising turn of events, Justice Bor ruled in favor of Mombasa Cement, validating the company's counterclaims of fraud and improper acquisition against the Ramjis.

The ruling shocked many and was perceived as a glaring miscarriage of justice.

Undeterred, the Ramjis appealed to the Court of Appeal and their persistence paid off.

In Civil Appeal No. 590 of 2019, the appellate judges ‚Äì Justices Musinga, Ngenye, and Omondi ‚Äì delivered a scathing critique of the lower court's judgment.

They meticulously dismantled the arguments presented by Mombasa Cement and acknowledged the validity of the Ramjis' title.

The Court of Appeal ordered that the land be restored to the Ramjis and Mombasa Cement evicted.

By March 2024, the property was rightfully back in the hands of its owners which marked a legal victory for the family.

But the victory was short-lived.

Mombasa Cement (leveraging its connections within the corridors of power) launched a retaliatory campaign.

Using its influence, particularly its involvement in constructing police station walls in Mombasa and Nairobi, Mombasa Cement enlisted the help of high-ranking officers within the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) and reportedly hatched a plan to reverse the Court of Appeal's decision.

The strategy was to use their authority to harass and intimidate the Ramji family in an attempt to coerce them into relinquishing their land once more.

The summonses came swiftly.

Bharat, Harish, and Ashvin Ramji were repeatedly called in for questioning by the DCI.

Under relentless pressure, they turned to the judicial system for protection.

Kiambu High Court became their refuge.

On 24th April 2024, Bharat Ramji, Harish Ramji and Ashvin Ramji obtained crucial judicial review orders from the Kiambu High Court which were signed by Hon. Lady Justice Dorah Chepkwony. 

These orders were issued to restrain the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) and the Inspector General of Police from arresting or harassing the Ramji family. 

The application was certified as urgent.

Court granted leave to the Ramjis to file a substantive judicial review application which allowed them to formally challenge the actions of the DCI and the Inspector General of Police.

The leave granted operated as a stay, meaning that any actions by the DCI or the Inspector General of Police to arrest or harass the Ramjis were temporarily halted pending the hearing and determination of the substantive judicial review 

The matter was set for mention on 20th June 2024 to confirm compliance with the court orders and to ensure that the judicial process was being followed correctly.

DCI and Inspector General of Police were given seven days upon service of the court orders to file their response to the judicial review application.

Despite having been served with orders restraining the arrest via Kiambu High Court Judicial Review Case No. HCJR/E010/2024, Wilhelm K. Kimutai (emboldened by his connections and a misplaced sense of invincibility) continued his campaign of harassment, ignoring the High Court's orders and further complicating the Ramji family's efforts to reclaim their property.

In their detailed judgment, the Court of Appeal judges found substantial flaws in the initial trial court's handling of the case.

They pointed out several key misdirections.

The appellate court noted that the trial judge had disregarded crucial evidence regarding the assignment of the suit property from Golden Terrace to the Ramjis.

""The learned judge failed to appreciate and give effect to the provisions of section 23 (1) of the Registration of Titles Act,"" the Court of Appeal stated.

The Court of Appeal also underscored the indefensibility of the Ramjis' title, stating, ""There was no dispute that they were the registered proprietors of the suit property."" The judges criticized the trial court for not recognizing this legal fact.

Addressing the clerical error in the transfer documents, the Court of Appeal clarified, ""It is obvious that there was a clerical error in the preparation of the transfer document in making reference to LR No. 11895/48 when the subject matter in the entire transfer was LR No. 11895/50.""",31,115,bullying detected

Episodes: 4
Airs: Jun 7, 2024 - Jun 28, 2024
Airs On: Friday
Original Network: One 31

Main Cast: Charlotte Austin , Engfa Waraha

Plot
In the era of social media, everyone can freely express their opinions about others. They can use harsh words without much consideration, not thinking about the consequences or verifying the truth.

In a relationship between two women, one becomes overly concerned with the opinions of others, making her vulnerable to someone she doesn't know who ends up hurting her. The second woman has never cared much, firmly believing in the adage ""to each their own."" However, at times, she can be remarkably oblivious to the feelings of those around her.

With their love in the spotlight, eyes across the nation scrutinise their every move, passing judgement on ever action.

"Remember when you were a kid - there was always that one kid who used to literally get away with everything. A kid could either talk their way out of trouble or had a few friends or parents in high places who would cover up their misadventures or bully others into ‚Äúforgetting‚Äù about it.

It amounted to zero consequences for the little zunt - and a fast developing attitude that they could literally go through life expecting no consequences for any actions.

Some of those kids might grow out of it after they‚Äôve ‚Äúlearned a lesson or two‚Äù - but others remain forever that little zunt who could do no wrong - and to accuse them of anything - regardless of their nefarious actions  - would result in everybody but them having a bad day.

I see it re-enacted over and over again in politics and business via people in positions of power - and by those who want that power and think that they deserve it, regardless of how undeserving they are. 

That little zunt literally destroys democracy because they have no respect for equality or fairness and they have no boundaries.

I can think of a few people like that. The more entitled they have been raised to be - or learned to be - and have gotten away with it - the more likely they are to be boundary free narcissists and sociopaths.

"Theres this false narrative going around that I ‚Äúdefended Nick‚Äù & am therefore ‚Äúpro child neglect/abuse including drugs & swinging‚Äù. This false narrative has been repeated in my mentions for days all because I‚Äôm guilty of not immediately giving my opinion & condemning Nick. Every time I‚Äôve confronted someone accusing me of this I ask for them to provide me with one single receipt and they can‚Äôt because they don‚Äôt exist. You want to get mad because I‚Äôve been on stream with people who have opinions you do or don‚Äôt like & I didn‚Äôt say anything? Well newsflash I rarely chime in to topics I have zero desire to discuss. Just because others have opinions doesn‚Äôt mean I agree with them simply because I‚Äôm in their presence. I think water tastes disgusting; I‚Äôm in fully aware that 99.9% of the population disagrees & that‚Äôs fine. Just because you‚Äôre in my presence doesn‚Äôt mean you automatically share my views(crazy how that works right).

Now another accusation is that I‚Äôm ‚Äúdefending Nick‚Äù because I called out Aaron.  Idk if it‚Äôs willing ignorance or you‚Äôre just not intelligent enough to understand that just because you‚Äôve deemed one person the ultimate villain does not disqualify other monsters in the situation. Before all this started I didn‚Äôt know who tf this guy was. What I saw was a total sleezeball capitalizing on a situation for personal gain at the expense of children. My entire timeline was full of this jackass stirring the pot with disgusting sex stories that had nothing to actually do with the case but were just his ‚Äúinside scoop‚Äù for his 15minutes of fame. It absolutely disgusted me that someone could say the things he did stream after stream with a gigantic smile on his face. He knew those kids & claimed to care but was just a POS that didn‚Äôt do anything & yet still instead of helping them only continued to make their lives worse. They‚Äôre from a small town & this is a huge scandal. They‚Äôre already being judged by everyone around them & anyone including them can look up their last name & find any of the streams/clips of that jackass talking shit about their parents. Now if you still don‚Äôt understand why I would choose to call that shit out idk what to tell you this is something even Forest Gump would understand. 

Lastly all this situation has done has open my eyes to the amount of cancel culture pigs on my timeline. Every single one of you that accused me shit because I kept my opinions to myself are no better than the wackos that went after Gina or anyone else that steps out of line & doesn‚Äôt conform to your ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù. I‚Äôve seen your tweets & know who you are. All of you with the ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not with me then you‚Äôre my enemy‚Äù narrative should really take a step back and think about what you‚Äôre doing because It‚Äôs not good. Maybe take a minute & apply some common sense before demonizing me of ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù I didn‚Äôt commit or making accusations against me because I didn‚Äôt ‚Äústep in line‚Äù in the what you considered is a timely manner. Canceling me over your imaginary opinions won‚Äôt end well & forcing me to bend the knee to your will is only going to end in disappointment for you. I don‚Äôt put up with that kind of bs & I never will. 

At the end of the day my opinion on this really doesn‚Äôt matter nor will it change a single thing. Those kids have seen enough & me adding to it ultimately will not help. Everyone that actually knows me knows where I stand on this including Nick. Going after me with pitchforks because you want blood isn‚Äôt going to solve anything.

"High Court and Court of Appeal Ruling Ignored as Senior DCI Officers Harass Landowner 

In 2010, Bharat Ramji, Harish Ramji, and Ashvin Ramji purchased a parcel of land from the National Social Security Fund (NSSF).

This prime real estate situated along Mombasa Road Next to the Mombasa Cement factory was a major investment but what began as a promising acquisition soon spiraled into a bitter legal battle marked by fraud, goon invasion, and allegations of corruption within our law enforcement system.

The Ramji family's ordeal started innocuously enough.

They acquired the land legally, receiving the title deed from NSSF.

But as fate would have it, Mombasa Cement Limited, a powerful entity with deep connections, had its sights set on the same land.

In a brazen move, Mombasa Cement deposited money into the NSSF account without any formal agreement or authorization, following which they orchestrated an illegal eviction of the Ramjis using hired goons who not only evicted them but also demolished parts of the boundary wall to amalgamate the property with their own factory premises.

The Ramjis, now dispossessed of their land, sought justice in the High Court at Milimani.

Justice Kossy Bor presided over the case, which seemed straightforward enough given the clear legal ownership documents the Ramjis held but in a surprising turn of events, Justice Bor ruled in favor of Mombasa Cement, validating the company's counterclaims of fraud and improper acquisition against the Ramjis.

The ruling shocked many and was perceived as a glaring miscarriage of justice.

Undeterred, the Ramjis appealed to the Court of Appeal and their persistence paid off.

In Civil Appeal No. 590 of 2019, the appellate judges ‚Äì Justices Musinga, Ngenye, and Omondi ‚Äì delivered a scathing critique of the lower court's judgment.

They meticulously dismantled the arguments presented by Mombasa Cement and acknowledged the validity of the Ramjis' title.

The Court of Appeal ordered that the land be restored to the Ramjis and Mombasa Cement evicted.

By March 2024, the property was rightfully back in the hands of its owners which marked a legal victory for the family.

But the victory was short-lived.

Mombasa Cement (leveraging its connections within the corridors of power) launched a retaliatory campaign.

Using its influence, particularly its involvement in constructing police station walls in Mombasa and Nairobi, Mombasa Cement enlisted the help of high-ranking officers within the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) and reportedly hatched a plan to reverse the Court of Appeal's decision.

The strategy was to use their authority to harass and intimidate the Ramji family in an attempt to coerce them into relinquishing their land once more.

The summonses came swiftly.

Bharat, Harish, and Ashvin Ramji were repeatedly called in for questioning by the DCI.

Under relentless pressure, they turned to the judicial system for protection.

Kiambu High Court became their refuge.

On 24th April 2024, Bharat Ramji, Harish Ramji and Ashvin Ramji obtained crucial judicial review orders from the Kiambu High Court which were signed by Hon. Lady Justice Dorah Chepkwony. 

These orders were issued to restrain the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) and the Inspector General of Police from arresting or harassing the Ramji family. 

The application was certified as urgent.

Court granted leave to the Ramjis to file a substantive judicial review application which allowed them to formally challenge the actions of the DCI and the Inspector General of Police.

The leave granted operated as a stay, meaning that any actions by the DCI or the Inspector General of Police to arrest or harass the Ramjis were temporarily halted pending the hearing and determination of the substantive judicial review 

The matter was set for mention on 20th June 2024 to confirm compliance with the court orders and to ensure that the judicial process was being followed correctly.

DCI and Inspector General of Police were given seven days upon service of the court orders to file their response to the judicial review application.

Despite having been served with orders restraining the arrest via Kiambu High Court Judicial Review Case No. HCJR/E010/2024, Wilhelm K. Kimutai (emboldened by his connections and a misplaced sense of invincibility) continued his campaign of harassment, ignoring the High Court's orders and further complicating the Ramji family's efforts to reclaim their property.

In their detailed judgment, the Court of Appeal judges found substantial flaws in the initial trial court's handling of the case.

They pointed out several key misdirections.

The appellate court noted that the trial judge had disregarded crucial evidence regarding the assignment of the suit property from Golden Terrace to the Ramjis.

""The learned judge failed to appreciate and give effect to the provisions of section 23 (1) of the Registration of Titles Act,"" the Court of Appeal stated.

The Court of Appeal also underscored the indefensibility of the Ramjis' title, stating, ""There was no dispute that they were the registered proprietors of the suit property."" The judges criticized the trial court for not recognizing this legal fact.

Addressing the clerical error in the transfer documents, the Court of Appeal clarified, ""It is obvious that there was a clerical error in the preparation of the transfer document in making reference to LR No. 11895/48 when the subject matter in the entire transfer was LR No. 11895/50.""",32,115,bullying detected

"Long post warning üö® 

I think I‚Äôve figured out why I‚Äôm so turned off with the current left: they have become the establishment. 

Growing up the Republican Party, with its oppressive brand of moral conservatism, felt like the owners of the ‚Äúestablishment.‚Äù

The hippies and the left were a reaction to that. Free love, rock and roll, anti-war, anti-establishment.  That was followed by punk rock culture ‚Äî liberals continued to be the standard bearers of the antiestablishment. 

Even into the 90s/2000s, you had anti-war liberals pushing back against the Falwell moral majority and protesting the Iraq war (that was me üëã).  Then the pushback to the disastrous neocon political movement of the post-9/11 2000s. 

Then it all started to change. Trump in 2016 flipped everything on its head. Suddenly republicans were much less hawkish, ignoring foreign wars. and the liberals lost their mind with TDS. So everything then became a reaction to trump. 

Then covid hit and things really got weird. 

Liberals started pushing for even greater state control. Forced closures of businesses, executive orders, vaccine mandates, clamping down on constitutional rights. 

And they also started cheering US military action abroad in the Ukraine. Obama started this with his love for drone warfare. Now we see the left cheering the political prosecution of their political opponents. Grim. 

So now, all the sudden, the anti-establishment left of the last 60 years has swung hard to become the people they‚Äôve fought against.

"Theres this false narrative going around that I ‚Äúdefended Nick‚Äù & am therefore ‚Äúpro child neglect/abuse including drugs & swinging‚Äù. This false narrative has been repeated in my mentions for days all because I‚Äôm guilty of not immediately giving my opinion & condemning Nick. Every time I‚Äôve confronted someone accusing me of this I ask for them to provide me with one single receipt and they can‚Äôt because they don‚Äôt exist. You want to get mad because I‚Äôve been on stream with people who have opinions you do or don‚Äôt like & I didn‚Äôt say anything? Well newsflash I rarely chime in to topics I have zero desire to discuss. Just because others have opinions doesn‚Äôt mean I agree with them simply because I‚Äôm in their presence. I think water tastes disgusting; I‚Äôm in fully aware that 99.9% of the population disagrees & that‚Äôs fine. Just because you‚Äôre in my presence doesn‚Äôt mean you automatically share my views(crazy how that works right).

Now another accusation is that I‚Äôm ‚Äúdefending Nick‚Äù because I called out Aaron.  Idk if it‚Äôs willing ignorance or you‚Äôre just not intelligent enough to understand that just because you‚Äôve deemed one person the ultimate villain does not disqualify other monsters in the situation. Before all this started I didn‚Äôt know who tf this guy was. What I saw was a total sleezeball capitalizing on a situation for personal gain at the expense of children. My entire timeline was full of this jackass stirring the pot with disgusting sex stories that had nothing to actually do with the case but were just his ‚Äúinside scoop‚Äù for his 15minutes of fame. It absolutely disgusted me that someone could say the things he did stream after stream with a gigantic smile on his face. He knew those kids & claimed to care but was just a POS that didn‚Äôt do anything & yet still instead of helping them only continued to make their lives worse. They‚Äôre from a small town & this is a huge scandal. They‚Äôre already being judged by everyone around them & anyone including them can look up their last name & find any of the streams/clips of that jackass talking shit about their parents. Now if you still don‚Äôt understand why I would choose to call that shit out idk what to tell you this is something even Forest Gump would understand. 

Lastly all this situation has done has open my eyes to the amount of cancel culture pigs on my timeline. Every single one of you that accused me shit because I kept my opinions to myself are no better than the wackos that went after Gina or anyone else that steps out of line & doesn‚Äôt conform to your ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù. I‚Äôve seen your tweets & know who you are. All of you with the ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not with me then you‚Äôre my enemy‚Äù narrative should really take a step back and think about what you‚Äôre doing because It‚Äôs not good. Maybe take a minute & apply some common sense before demonizing me of ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù I didn‚Äôt commit or making accusations against me because I didn‚Äôt ‚Äústep in line‚Äù in the what you considered is a timely manner. Canceling me over your imaginary opinions won‚Äôt end well & forcing me to bend the knee to your will is only going to end in disappointment for you. I don‚Äôt put up with that kind of bs & I never will. 

At the end of the day my opinion on this really doesn‚Äôt matter nor will it change a single thing. Those kids have seen enough & me adding to it ultimately will not help. Everyone that actually knows me knows where I stand on this including Nick. Going after me with pitchforks because you want blood isn‚Äôt going to solve anything. It just exposes you cancel pigs for who you truly are.",29,556,bullying detected

"#NarcissisticAbuse is a devastating form of emotional and psychological abuse caused by someone with high narcissistic traits. It involves a range of manipulative behaviors like gaslighting, blame-shifting, devaluation, and constant belittling and criticism that erodes your self-esteem. The abuser will try to control and isolates you, cutting you off from support and making you feel dependent and powerless. They may alternate between being nice and cruel, leaving you in a constant state of anxiety, desperately seeking their approval. The victim may look like they are lying or crazy when they try to explain what‚Äôs going on because the narcissist‚Äôs two-faced nature is shamelessly hidden behind a mask of charm, lies, manipulation and smear campaigns. This kind of abuse can lead to serious emotional damage, including anxiety, depression, a loss of self-worth, and in extreme cases, C-PTSD, self medication, or suicide. It could be described as covert psychological violence.",228,509,bullying detected
